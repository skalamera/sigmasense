# Intro to control elements

# Intro to control elements

Add control elements to a workbook to provide predefined interactions to users viewing or customizing a workbook, such as inputs that modify data, selections to filter data or change displayed data, drilldown paths, or other ways of manipulating data.

You can also add control elements to data models, centralizing filter management and allowing you to reference control values as parameters in calculated columns.

Control elements provide powerful configuration options to a workbook:

* Build interactivity in a workbook, such as by adding a text input control that passes data to an AI query in a calculated column. See [Perform AI queries](/docs/perform-ai-queries).
* Reference control values in formulas, enabling calculated columns that change based on user input. See [Reference control values as parameters](/docs/parameters-in-workbooks).
* Perform dynamic filtering in SQL statements by referencing control values. See [Reference workbook control values in SQL statements](/docs/reference-workbook-control-values-in-sql-statements).
* Change the granularity of data displayed in a workbook based on user selection. See [Create and configure a segmented control](/docs/segmented-control).
* Enable predefined drilldown and drill up paths for one or more visualizations. See [Drill down control](/docs/drill-down-control).
* Build a form to enter data into an input table and write back to your data platform.
* Define an action that sets a control value, allowing you to build a complex workflow. See [Create actions that manage control values](/docs/create-actions-that-manage-control-values).
* Burst different copies of a report to different recipients based on the available values of a control. See [Export as email burst](/docs/export-as-email-burst).

> When executing a scheduled export or direct download to PDF or PNG formats, Sigma may store applicable control values as URL parameters in trace logs used for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. Exercise caution when using controls to filter sensitive data.

## Filters and controls

You can filter a data element in several different ways:

* Filter one data element by adding filters to directly on columns in the data element. After you create a filter on a data element, you can convert it to a control. See [Filter data in data elements](/docs/data-element-filters).
* Filter the data sources of a workbook and one or more data elements in a workbook by adding a control element and adding targets to each data element. See [Create and manage a control element](/docs/create-and-manage-a-control-element).
* Filter data directly in the query by adding a control and referencing the control in a SQL statement. See [Reference workbook control values in SQL statements](/docs/reference-workbook-control-values-in-sql-statements).
* Filter data elements with the same control settings on multiple pages by adding a page control with synced copies. See [Synced controls](/docs/synced-controls).

When you filter data in a data element, the filtering affects downstream and child elements. If you create a filter on a parent element, the filter cannot be viewed or modified from child elements. SeeÂ [Filter data in data elements](/docs/data-element-filters).

For more best practices, see [Best practices for using filters, controls, and parameters](/docs/dynamically-filter-and-modify-data-in-sigma#best-practices-for-using-filters-controls-and-parameters).

## About control IDs

When you add a control to a workbook, Sigma automatically generates a control ID. You can use the ID to reference values of the control when exporting a workbook or target elements, in custom SQL statements, when constructing an embed URL, or when using different Sigma REST API endpoints. The ID is also used internally for references between controls and their targets.

You can change a control ID, but doing so might break existing references to the control. You can always update the control label.

When you duplicate a control, the new control has the same behavior and formatting as the original, but the ID is updated to be unique.

When you sync controls, they share the same ID. See [Synced controls](/docs/synced-controls).

## Types of controls

Control elements support a wide range of options, including all filter types:

* [List values](#list-values)
* [Text input](#text-input)
* [Text area](#text-area)
* [Segmented control](#segmented-control)
* [Number input](#number-input)
* [Number range](#number-range)
* [Slider](#slider)
* [Range slider](#range-slider)
* [Date](#date)
* [Date range](#date-range)
* [Top N](#top-n)
* [Drill down](#drill-down)
* [Switch](#switch)
* [Checkbox](#checkbox)
* [Legend](#legend)

To create a control, see [Create and manage a control element](/docs/create-and-manage-a-control-element) .

### List values

Include or exclude selected values in a list. Up to 200 values can be displayed in the list control.

* **Input type**: List of selectable values.
* **[Supported data types](/docs/data-types-and-formats)**: Text, Number, Date, Logical
* **Parameter output type**:
  + If multiple selection is enabled, array of data type selected.
  + If multiple selection is disabled, single value of data type selected.
* **Examples**:
  + Select multiple page paths to include for several elements on a website analytics workbook.
  + Select relevant ID numbers to exclude from a table.
  + Choose the current and previous quarter from a list to include only those quarters in a chart.
  + Select false and null values for a survey column to include only those in a table.

#### Interactive example of a list values control

In the following interactive example, interact with the **Year** list values control. Click to open the dropdown menu, then select the sales years you want to show in the chart. Both targeted data elements respond to your changes.

### Text input

Search values in the targeted data element column(s) for full and partial matches between the text input and your dataâ€™s values.

* **Input type**: Enter text in a text box. If the option is shown, the user can select an operator.
* **[Supported data types](/docs/data-types-and-formats)**: Text
* **Parameter output type**: Single value text string. Operators are not available with the control value.
* **Examples**:
  + View data where the text contains "Total".
  + View data for host names that start with "https://www".
  + View data where the text does not contain "Not Applicable".
  + View data where the text ends with "EOF", case sensitive.
  + View data where the text matches "total" or "subtotal" using a regular expression `total|subtotal`.

#### Configure text input

You can configure operators for a text input control which control the matching conditions for the inputted text, including Contains, Starts with, Ends with, and Like, as well as the corresponding exclude operators: Does not contain, Does not start with, Does not end with, and Not like. You can also provide regular expressions with Matches Regexp and Does not match RegExp operators.

### Text area

Search for full and partial matches between the inputted text and the targeted data values. Also useful for providing text input to a formula by referencing the control as a parameter.

* **Input type**: Enter text into a text area.
* **[Supported data types](/docs/data-types-and-formats)**: Text
* **Parameter output type**: Single value text string.
* **Examples**:
  + Provide a text prompt to pass to an AI query function.
  + Add notes from a conversation in a form to update an input table.

#### Configure number input

You can configure filters for a text input control to control the matching conditions for the inputted number. Choose from `<=` (less than or equal to), `=` (equal to), or `>=` (greater than or equal to). Defaults to `=`.

### Number range

Enter a minimum number and/or a maximum number for a range to filter the results in targeted data elements. The range is inclusive of the entered numbers.
