# Export to Google Sheets

You can send one or more individual workbook elements to Google Sheets on a set schedule or an as-needed basis. When you export to Google Sheets on a schedule, the same Google Sheet is replaced (overwritten) each time the schedule runs. See [Schedule an export to Google Sheets](/docs/schedule-exports-to-google-sheets-or-drive#schedule-exports-to-google-sheets).

Sigma generates exports from the workbook's latest published version. Changes you make to a workbook draft, custom view, or exploration cannot be exported unless you save or publish the changes. Depending on your export destination, you can also choose to export a saved view or tagged version of the workbook. If you are exporting elements that are only on a saved view, you must open the export modal from the saved view.

For a matrix of supported file formats and saved view/version tag export support, see [Available export destinations and formats](/docs/send-or-schedule-workbook-exports#available-export-destinations-and-formats).

## User requirements

The ability to export to Google Sheets requires the following:

* You must be assigned an [account type](/docs/create-and-manage-account-types) with the **Export to Google Sheet** permission enabled.
* You must be an Editor of the specified Google Sheet.

## Google account authorization

The first time you export or schedule an export to Google Sheets or Google Drive, Sigma prompts you to authorize Sigma to export to your Google account:

![Dialog showing \"you can now export your data into Google Drive. You will need to authorize Sigma to access your Google Drive.\](https://files.readme.io/feab067440de15865df7eef8e3f2bdab8cc316c31eca1f720adbafa0f207d227-export-to-drive.png)

Click **Authorize** and follow the instructions on your screen. After you complete the authorization, you return to the **Export**Â or **Schedule Exports** dialog.
