For a brief overview of Sigma concepts and the user interface, see [Sigma basics](/docs/sigma-basics) and [Get around in Sigma](/docs/get-around-in-sigma).

## Perform ad hoc analysis and explore your data

Explore data from your data platform with ad hoc analysis. Start exploring from a table or a chart, and if your analysis is valuable, save it for later.

Start [exploring your data in Sigma](/docs/ad-hoc-data-explorations).

## Build enterprise-grade analytics

Whether you craft dashboards or live in spreadsheets, you can build enterprise-grade analytics in Sigma.

Your data stays in your data platform, and you can model complex data workflows and analyze in tables, pivot tables, charts, and maps.

Collaborate live with other analysts, and supplement your analysis with AI-based functionality. Share insights with others outside of Sigma by exporting reports.

Get started building analytics:

* [Get started with data modeling](/docs/get-started-with-data-modeling).
* Start working with [data elements](/docs/create-a-data-element) and [workbooks](/docs/workbooks-overview), such as a [table](/docs/create-and-manage-tables) or a [chart](/docs/intro-to-visualizations).
* Perform simple and complex calculations with [over 200 functions](/docs/function-index).
* Supplement your analysis by performing [AI queries](/docs/perform-ai-queries).
* Share reports as PDF files, images, or raw data with [exports](/docs/send-or-schedule-workbook-exports).
* Improve availability of data from slow-running queries with [materialization](/docs/materialization).

## Develop powerful data applications

Activate workflows with your data by developing applications with real-time data from your data platform.

When you develop a data application in Sigma, you can:

* Write back data to your data platform with [input tables](/docs/intro-to-input-tables).
* Add interactivity and filtering with [control elements](/docs/intro-to-control-elements).
* Chain complex actions together with [sequenced actions](/docs/intro-to-actions).
* Design application-like behavior using UI components like [modals](/docs/add-a-modal-to-a-workbook).

## Embed analytics

Sigma offers flexible embedding options that enable you to seamlessly integrate comprehensive analytics into various web applications and workflows. You can deliver Sigma content and capabilities directly to your own end users to enhance the user experience in existing systems.

Embed your insights:

* Explore the possibilities of [embedded analytics](/docs/intro-to-embedded-analytics).
* Dive deeper into real-world use cases with the [Embedding QuickStarts](https://quickstarts.sigmacomputing.com/?cat=embedding).
