# Enable or disable audit logging

Sigma facilitates audit logging through the *Sigma Audit Logs* connection, which records data related to user-initiated events that occur within your Sigma organization. The connection is disabled by default, but an **Admin** user can enable it in the **Administration** portal.

This document explains how to enable or disable the *Sigma Audit Logs* connection. For more information about audit logging with Sigma, see the following:

   2. Select **Administration** to open the **Administration** portal.
   3. In the side panel, select **Account**, then open the **General Settings** tab.
2. In the **Audit Logging** section, locate the **Sigma Audit Logs** setting and click **Enable**. The setting displays a **Feature Pending** tag while the audit log connection activates.

   > If the **General Settings** tab doesnâ€™t include an **Audit Logging** section, contact Sigma Support or your Sigma Account Executive to enable it for your organization.
3. The connection typically activates within a few minutes, and Sigma sends a confirmation email when the connection is successfully enabled. Click **Open in Sigma** in the email or refresh the **Administration** portal, then click **Browse Connection** in the **Sigma Audit Logs** setting to view the connection data.

## Disable the Sigma Audit Log connection

You can disable audit logging for your Sigma organization. If you wish to re-enable your audit logs, Sigma stores your data related to user-initiated events captured before you disabled audit logging for 30 days. If you re-enable audit logging you can recover that data, but you will need to reconfigure any:

* Storage integrations
* Scheduled exports
