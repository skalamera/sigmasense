# Download workbook data

You can download an entire workbook, a specific workbook page, or a specific workbook element from Sigma at any time. You can also schedule an export or send a scheduled export on-demand. See [About exporting workbooks](/docs/send-or-schedule-workbook-exports).

If you attempt to export a workbook while editing it, you only have the option to download the draft version. If you want to download the published version or export to other destinations, open the published version of the workbook.

> When executing a scheduled export or direct download to PDF or PNG formats, Sigma may store applicable control values as URL parameters in trace logs used for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. Exercise caution when exporting or downloading workbook content that uses controls to filter sensitive data.
