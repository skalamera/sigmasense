# Embed SDK for React

# Embed SDK for React

Sigma provides several methods to allow users and developers to interact with its systems, including a web user interface, a public REST API, a JavaScript Embed API, and an SDK for the React framework.

The Embed SDK for React offers a higher-level, developer-friendly interface that simplifies integration into applications, in contrast to Sigmaâ€™s lower-level JavaScript Embed API, which provides more granular control but may require additional coding.

The source code is freely available on [Github](https://github.com/sigmacomputing/embed-sdk.git). Developers can clone the repository and refer to the comments in the code for each file.

Additionally, there is a [QuickStart](https://quickstarts.sigmacomputing.com/guide/embedding_15_embed_sdk/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) for a more in-depth guide to using the SDK.

The source contains a working application with a sample embed based on Sigma provided content.
