# View and manage existing actions

Each workbook page features an overview that lists all elements containing actions. Select an element from this list (or directly on the page) to view and manage its actions.

This document explains how to view, edit, duplicate, and delete existing actions in workbooks. For information about creating new actions, see the **Related resources** section at the end of this page.

## User requirements

> ðŸ“˜

> ### The following requirements apply to members who view and manage actions. Users who access and interact with a workbook can typically trigger all existing actions within it. Any restrictions are noted in this document.

The ability to view and manage actions requires the following:

* You must be assigned an [account type](/docs/license-and-account-type-overview) with the **Full explore** or **Create, edit, and publish workbooks** permission enabled.
* You must be the workbook owner or be granted **Can explore**1 or **Can edit** [workbook permission](/docs/license-and-account-type-overview).

1If youâ€™re granted **Can explore** workbook permission, you can configure actions but cannot save changes to the workbookâ€™s published version.

## View configured actions

1. Open the draft, custom view, or saved view of a workbook.

## Duplicate a sequence or action

Duplicate an existing sequence or action to leverage and modify its configurations.
