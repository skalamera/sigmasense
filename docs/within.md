## Syntax

```
Within(geography1, geography2)
```

The function has these arguments:

geography1
:   Required
:   The geography value that might be contained within geography2.
:   Can be a point, a line, or polygon

geography2
:   Required
:   The geography value that might contain geography1.

## Examples

```
Within(Geography("POLYGON((1 1, 2 1, 2 2, 1 2, 1 1))"), Geography("POLYGON((0 0, 3 0, 3 3, 0 3, 0 0))"))
```

The function returns `True`, because the first polygon is fully contained within the second.

```
Within([Centroid], [Coordinates])
```

```
Within(MakePoint(-73.985428, 40.748817), [Coordinates])
```

The first **Within** function determines if the **Centroid** of the polygon is within the polygon, while the second function determines if the Empire State Building (-73.985428, 40.748817) is within the polygon.

```

The **Within** function determines if the values in the **Coordinates** column are within the boundaries of Brooklyn.
