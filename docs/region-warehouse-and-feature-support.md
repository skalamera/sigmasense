# Supported regions, data platforms, and features

Sigma supports various cloud platforms and regions, connections to many data platforms, and some features are supported only on specific data platforms.

## Supported cloud platforms and regions

Your Sigma organization is hosted on one of the following cloud platforms:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Microsoft Azure
* Google Cloud (GCP)

Your cloud deployment is chosen when your Sigma organization is created, and cannot be migrated or changed after creation.

> ðŸ’¡
>
> If you're unsure which cloud platform hosts your organization, you can reference it in the **Administration** portal (if you're assigned the **Admin** [account type](/docs/user-account-types)). Go to **Administration** > **Account** > **General Settings**, then locate the **Site** section. The **Cloud** field identifies the platform hosting your organization.

The following table lists the specific supported cloud regions:

| Cloud platform | Region | Location | Cloud region code | API endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AWS logo | **United States West** | Oregon | us-west-2 (primary) us-east-1 (disaster recovery) | aws-api.sigmacomputing.com |
| **United States East** | N. Virginia | us-east-1 (primary) us-west-2 (disaster recovery) | api.us-a.aws.sigmacomputing.com |
| **Canada** | Central | ca-central-1 | api.ca.aws.sigmacomputing.com |
| **Europe** | Frankfurt | eu-central-1 (primary) eu-north-1 (disaster recovery) | api.eu.aws.sigmacomputing.com |
| **Asia Pacific** | Sydney | ap-southeast-2 | api.au.aws.sigmacomputing.com |
| **United Kingdom** | London | eu-west-2 (primary) eu-west-1 (disaster recovery) | api.uk.aws.sigmacomputing.com |
| Azure logo | **United States** | Virginia | eastus2 (primary) centralus (disaster recovery) | api.us.azure.sigmacomputing.com |
| **Europe1** | Netherlands | westeurope (primary) northeurope (disaster recovery) | api.eu.azure.sigmacomputing.com |
| **Canada** | Toronto | canadacentral (primary) canadaeast (disaster recovery) | api.ca.azure.sigmacomputing.com |
| **United Kingdom1** | London | uksouth (primary) ukwest (disaster recovery) | api.uk.azure.sigmacomputing.com |
| Google Cloud logo | **United States2** | Iowa | us-central-1 | api.sigmacomputing.com |

1Sigma users of Azure-hosted organizations in the EU and UK are not granted access to audit logs.

2GCP-hosted organizations don't support private connections.

## Supported data platforms and feature compatibility

Sigma connects to the following data platforms:

* AlloyDB
* Azure SQL Database
* Amazon Redshift
* Databricks
* Google BigQuery
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Snowflake
* Starburst Galaxy
* SQL Server 2022 and Azure SQL Managed Instance

Connections support most Sigma features; however, due to technical variations (like SQL dialects, architecture, and security) some features are not currently compatible with all data platforms. The following table lists current feature limitations for each connection type.
