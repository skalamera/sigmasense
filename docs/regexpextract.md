# RegexpExtract

The **RegexpExtract** function returns the substring that matches a regular expression within a string.

If the regular expression contains a [capture group](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/groups.html#:~:text=Capturing%20groups%20are%20a%20way,o%22%20and%20%22g%22%20.) (`(...)`) and there are one or more matches for that capture group, Sigma returns the first capture group across all matches. Otherwise, Sigma returns the full regular expression.

## Usage

```
RegexpExtract(string, substring, [position])
```

Function arguments:

* **string** (required): The string to search
* **substring** (required): The substring to extract with.
* **position** (optional): The index of the match to return.

> ### When the regular expression contains a slash, quotation or other special character, use a backslash (\) to escape the special character. Regexp can vary based on the database. Check the documentation of the database you use to find the correct syntax.

## Examples

```
RegexpExtract([Address], "[0-9]+")
```
