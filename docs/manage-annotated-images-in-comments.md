# Manage annotated image ability and storage period

By default Sigma allows users to take a screenshot of an element and add comments. For more information see [Annotate element images as comments](/docs/annotate-element-images-as-comments).

Admins can modify the default 3-month image storage period or disable this feature.

If comments are disabled, image annotations are also disabled. For more information see [Disable commenting](/docs/disable-commenting).
