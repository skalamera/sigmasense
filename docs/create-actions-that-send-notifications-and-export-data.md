# Create actions that send notifications and export data

# Create actions that send notifications and export data

You can create workbook actions that initiate direct downloads as well as exports to email, Slack channels, Microsoft Teams Channels, Microsoft SharePoint, webhooks, and cloud storage.

For email and Slack, you can create actions that send notifications to users and channels. These notifications can be configured independently of an export, and support both static and dynamic lists of users.

This document explains how to create actions that export workbook content to specific destinations or notify users by Slack and email. For more information about configuring these actions in Sigma, see [Intro to actions](/docs/intro-to-actions). For more information on exporting data, see [Export data.](/docs/schedule-a-conditional-export-or-alert)

## User requirements

> ðŸ“˜
>
> The following requirements apply to users who configure actions. Users who access and interact with a workbook can typically trigger all existing actions within it. Any restrictions are noted in this document.

The ability to configure actions requires the following:

* You must be assigned an [account type](/docs/license-and-account-type-overview) with the **Full explore** or **Create, edit, and publish workbooks** permission enabled.
* You must be the workbook owner or be granted **Can explore**1 or **Can edit** [access to the workbook](/docs/folder-and-document-permissions).

1If youâ€™re granted **Can explore** access to the workbook, you can configure actions in custom, saved, and shared views. Actions saved to views do not apply to the workbookâ€™s published version.

## Send notifications by email (Beta)

Create an action that emails selected recipients, without sending an attachment or export.

> ðŸ“˜
>
> ### This action can only be configured and triggered by users assigned an account type with the **Export to email** permission enabled.

1. Open the draft, custom view, or saved view of a workbook.
2. Select the trigger element (the element users must interact with to initiate the action).
3. In the editor panel, open the **Actions** tab.
4. [Create a new sequence](/docs/create-and-manage-action-sequences), or locate an existing sequence that you want to modify.
5. Select the default action (if creating a new sequence), or click ![](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Icons/button-add.svg) **Add action** to add a new action to the sequence.
6. In the modal, configure the required fields to define the response:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Action** | Select **Notify and export**. |
| **Destination** | Select **Email**. |
| **Recipient** | For **Specific users / teams**, enter one or more comma-separated email addresses for the recipients.  For **Dynamic recipients**, provide a list of users based on dynamic information from a control or formula. If your action is configured on a table, pivot table, or input table, you can also create a list of dynamic recipients from a column. |
| **Subject** | Enter a subject line for the email notification. For dynamic text, press **=** on your keyboard to open the formula bar and [configure dynamic text.](/docs/text-elements#add-dynamic-text-based-on-your-data) |
| **Message** | [optional] Enter a message to include in the email body. For dynamic text, press **=** on your keyboard to open the formula bar and [configure dynamic text](/docs/text-elements#add-dynamic-text-based-on-your-data). Sigma includes basic information about the sender and workbook in the email body. |
| **Link to workbook** | [optional] On by default. Turn the **Link to workbook** toggle on to include a link to the workbook in the email. When the toggle is turned on, you can select whether to link to the entire workbook (top of page 1), a specific page (top of specified page), or a specific element. |
| **Attachment** | Confirm that the **Attachment** toggle is turned off. |
| **More options** | [optional] Select the **Run queries as recipient** checkbox to run workbook queries as the recipient of the email. If deselected (default), queries run as the user who performs the action. When **Run queries as recipient** is enabled, each query runs separately per recipient. Larger list of recipients result in more queries and longer processing times. Each recipient must be a Sigma user, and the user who performs the action must have an account type with the **Run exports as recipient permission** enabled. |

7. If the trigger element is a plugin, select the name of the plugin configuration object under **Custom plugin**. In your code editor, refresh your plugin, then test the action in the workbook.

## Example: Slack notification workflow for new project tasks

You can configure workbook actions that send notifications to users about changes to a workbook, such as new data entry or changes to existing data.

In this example, imagine you're interacting with a project tracker data app. Users can add new projects, tasks, and statuses.

![A gif shows a user demonstrating a project tracker application, adding a task to a project.](https://files.readme.io/0c3888e79db402e74697fdbf6bcfbc309dea0ff2661fe55f21fe5be16c4d33ce-Schedule_Weekly_Recap_Clip.gif)

You decide to configure a workbook action to send a notification whenever a user assigns a new task. Currently, users add tasks by selecting Add Task, entering information into the provided modal, and clicking the Create Task button to add the task to an input table.

Using the **Notify and export** action, you can send a notification by Slack whenever someone clicks the Create Task button, so that users are always up to date when a task is assigned to them.

1. Navigate to the Create Task modal, and open the **Actions** panel.
2. Add an action to the **On click - primary** action sequence.
3. In the **Action** modal, configure the action:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Action** | Select **Notify and export**. |
| **Destination** | Select **Slack**. |
| **To** | Select **Dynamic recipients** and **Formula**  In the formula bar, enter the following formula: `Lookup([Employees/Slack ID], [ct-Task-Owner], [Employees/Name])`  In the context of this workbook, this formula uses a Lookup to return a Slack ID based on the name of the user currently selected in the Task Owner control. |
| **Message** | Enter a message to be sent to the user with the assigned task.  To tag them, press **=** on your keyboard to open the formula bar. In the formula bar, enter the following formula: `"<@" & Lookup([Employees/Slack ID], [ct-Task-Owner], [Employees/Name]) & ">"`  In the context of this workbook, this concatenates the user's Slack ID with the characters required to tag them in Slack. For more information on this, see [Format a slack message](/docs/format-a-slack-message). |
| **Attachment** | Turn the **Attachment** toggle off. |
| **More options** | Select the **Include link to workbook** checkbox. |

4. [optional] Click ![](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Icons/more.svg) **More** to add a condition to the **Action sequence**. In the example below, the condition `IsNotNull([ct-Task-Name])` prevents tasks from being published with a blank name.

![A screenshot of the Sigma UI shows a notification action configured according to this tutorial](https://files.readme.io/201744d9b9dcba14a6df6e368bb291e2e0b0a7ee601902a9c41a5bec59b8e486-Notification_Action_Configuration.png)
