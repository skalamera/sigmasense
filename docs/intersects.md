# Intersects

# Intersects

The **Intersects** function determines if one geography intersects another geography. If the two geographies intersect, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Intersects**Â is one of Sigma's [Geography functions](/docs/geography-functions-overview).

## Syntax

```
Intersects(geography1, geography2)
```

The function arguments are:

geography1
:   Required
:   The first geography to check for intersection.

geography2
:   Required
:   The second geography to check for intersection.

## Examples

```
Intersects(Geography("POLYGON((0 0, 2 0, 2 2, 0 2, 0 0))"), Geography("POLYGON((1 1, 3 1, 3 3, 1 3, 1 1))"))
```

The function returns `True` because the two polygons overlap.

```
Intersects([Brooklyn], [Queens])
```

If you define the Brooklyn and Queens boroughs as polygons (see [Geography functions overview](/docs/geography-functions-overview)Â for coordinates), then the **Intersects** function returns `True` because they share a waterway; see the following illustration.
