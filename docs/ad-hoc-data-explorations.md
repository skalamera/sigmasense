# Ad hoc data explorations

# Ad hoc data explorations

Explorations are unpublished [workbooks](/docs/workbooks-overview) that support ad hoc data analysis.

This documentation explains how to create a new exploration and return to an existing one to continue your analysis, share it with other organization users, or save it as a workbook.

> ðŸ“˜

> ### Sigma saves your explorations in the **Recent** page. You cannot delete saved explorations.

## User requirements

To create a new exploration, you must be assigned an [account type](/docs/license-and-account-type-overview) with the **Create, edit, and publish workbooks** permission enabled.

## Create a new exploration

Create an exploration the same way you create a new workbook. For more information, see [Create a workbook or exploration](/docs/create-a-workbook).

## Reopen a saved exploration

Reopen a saved exploration to continue your ad hoc data analysis.

1. Go to your **Home** page.
2. In the navigation menu, select **Recent**.
3. In the **Recent** page, select the **Explorations** tab to view a list of your past explorations.
4. Click the **Created on** date to open a specific exploration.

## Share an exploration

Share an exploration to allow other organization users to contribute to your ad hoc data analysis.

1. [Create a new exploration](#create-a-new-exploration) or [reopen a saved one](#reopen-a-saved-exploration).

## Save an exploration as a workbook
