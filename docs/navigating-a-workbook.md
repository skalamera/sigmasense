## User requirements

* Users with **Can view**, **Can explore** or **Can edit** permissions can view and navigate workbooks in their published state, but will see different options depending on their individual permissions.
* Users need **Can edit** permission to edit a workbook.

Depending on your workbook permissions, some of the options below might not be available. See [Workbook modes overview](/docs/workbook-modes-overview) for more information on individual user permissions.

## Navigate the published version of a workbook

Navigating a published workbook allows you to view existing data and insights. Depending on your individual user permissions, you may also be able to [modify or add new filters](/docs/data-element-filters), refresh data, create your own [custom](/docs/create-and-interact-with-custom-views) and [saved views](/docs/create-and-share-saved-views).

The following options are available in a published workbook. Some may be unavailable depending on your permissions.
