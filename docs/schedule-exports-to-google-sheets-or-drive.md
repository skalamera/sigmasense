# Export to Google Drive

You can send individual workbook elements, workbook pages, or an entire workbook to Google Drive on a set schedule or an as-needed basis. Depending on what you send to Google Drive, you can export data in different file formats. For details on supported file formats, see [Send or schedule workbook exports](/docs/send-or-schedule-workbook-exports).

To export directly to Google Sheets, see [Export to Google Sheets](/docs/export-to-google-sheets).

Sigma generates exports from the workbook's latest published version. Changes you make to a workbook draft, custom view, or exploration cannot be exported unless you save or publish the changes. Depending on your export destination, you can also choose to export a saved view or tagged version of the workbook. If you are exporting elements that are only on a saved view, you must open the export modal from the saved view.

For a matrix of supported file formats and saved view/version tag export support, see [Available export destinations and formats](/docs/send-or-schedule-workbook-exports#available-export-destinations-and-formats).

## User requirements

The ability to export to Google Drive requires the following:

* You must be assigned an [account type](/docs/create-and-manage-account-types) with the **Export to Google Drive** permission enabled.
* You must be a Manager, Content manager, or Contributor of the specified Google Drive folder.

## Google account authorization

The first time you export or schedule an export to Google Sheets or Google Drive, Sigma prompts you to authorize Sigma to export to your Google account:

![Dialog showing \"you can now export your data into Google Drive. You will need to authorize Sigma to access your Google Drive.\](https://files.readme.io/feab067440de15865df7eef8e3f2bdab8cc316c31eca1f720adbafa0f207d227-export-to-drive.png)

Click **Authorize** and follow the instructions on your screen. After you complete the authorization, you return to the **Export**Â or **Schedule Exports** dialog.

## Export to Google Drive as needed

To export to Google Drive:

1. From the workbook menu (![](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Icons/caret.svg)), select **Share and export> Export...**.
2. Select **Google Drive**.

   If this is the first time you've exported to a Google product, Sigma prompts you to enable the integration. See [Google account authorization](/docs/schedule-exports-to-google-sheets-or-drive#google-account-authorization).
3. For **Drive folder**, enter a name for a new folder to contain the export. You cannot use an existing folder. Exports create a file in the destination folder with a name that matches the following structure:
   `<Workbook Name>_<Element Name>_<Timestamp>`.
4. Click **Create folder**.
   Sigma creates the folder for you and displays the URL to the folder.
5. For **Attachments**, select the data and file formats that you want to export.
6. Click **Export**.

## Schedule an export to Google Drive

To schedule an export to Google Drive:

1. From the workbook menu (![](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Icons/caret.svg)), select **Share and export> Schedule exports...**.
2. If this is the first schedule for the workbook, click **Add schedule**, otherwise click **+ New schedule**.
3. Select **Google Drive**.

   If this is the first time you've created a scheduled export to Google, Sigma prompts you to enable the integration. See [Google account authorization](#google-account-authorization).

       > ðŸ“˜

     + (Optional) If you choose to send an export only **If a condition is met**, you can turn on the switch to stop notifying after a set number of occurrences per day, week, or in total. (This feature is in beta and subject to the [Beta features notice](/docs/sigma-product-releases#beta-features)).
