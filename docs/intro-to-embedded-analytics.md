# Intro to embedded analytics

Sigma offers flexible embedding options that enable you to seamlessly integrate comprehensive analytics into web applications and workflows. Deliver Sigma content and capabilities directly to your own end users, enhancing the user experience in your host application.

## Options for embedding

Sigma supports two embedding methods, public and secure:

* [Public embedding](/docs/create-and-manage-a-public-embed) provides open access to embedded content and is typically used to distribute non-sensitive information. For example, you might use public embedding to display a specific chart on a public webpage.
* [Secure embedding](/docs/create-a-secure-embed) offers flexible security options that adopt the host application's user security at runtime. Use a server-side API (embed API) to generate a one-time-use JWT-signed URL. Secure embedding lets you control what a user can interact with and view in the embedded content.

## Set up advanced data security

When you create a secure embed, you can implement advanced security features to ensure your embedded solutions meet all data access and security requirements. See [Restrict access to data in embedded content](/docs/restrict-access-to-data-in-embedded-content).

## Configure embedding functionality

Sigma's embedded analytics offer functionality to provide a seamless experience with your host application:

* [Implement inbound and outbound events](/docs/inbound-and-outbound-events-in-embeds) to enhance interactivity with your host application.
* [Set up display options](/docs/manage-iframes-for-embeds) when embedding content into your host application.
* [Use the embed SDK for React](/docs/embed-sdk-for-react) to simplify integration with your host application.

## Customize embedded content

Embedded solutions support Sigma's core functionality, allowing you to embed stable and customized content:

* [Use version tagging](/docs/add-version-tags-to-workbooks-and-data-models) to provide production-ready content separate from in-progress development versions of content.
* [Set up localization](/docs/manage-workbook-localization) to make sure embedded content is customized for the customer's locale.
* [Consider saved views](/docs/create-and-manage-bookmarks) to provide specifically filtered views of embedded content for different users and teams.
* [Set up custom themes and branding](/docs/create-and-manage-workbook-themes), including [custom fonts](/docs/custom-fonts) to align styling with your host application.
