# View and manage document badges

Set certification badges (endorsed, warning, and deprecated) on workbooks and data models to reflect document status, quality, and reliability.

For example, use badges to indicate stages in the data model lifecycle as follows:

* **Endorsed**: The data model is verified, trusted, and meets quality standards.
* **Warning**: The data model is outdated, incomplete, or under review.
* **Deprecated**: The data model is obsolete or no longer maintained.

This document explains how to view, set, and delete badges on workbooks and data models. For information about adding certification badges to datasets and database tables, see [Create and manage datasets](/docs/create-and-manage-datasets) and [Review and manage your data catalog](/docs/manage-data-catalog).

## User requirements

The ability to set or delete a badge requires the following:

* You must be assigned an [account type](/docs/license-and-account-type-overview) with the **Manage all badges** permission enabled.
* You must be the document owner or be granted any [document permission](/docs/folder-and-document-permissions).

Badges are visible to any user granted access to the document.

## View existing badges

You can view badges from the Home page, or from an individual workbook:

* **Home page**: From the Home page, select **My documents**. You can see which of your recently accessed documents have badges assigned.
* **Within a workbook**: Badges are displayed in the document menu (next to the name of the workbook).

2. In the header, click the document name and select **File** > **Set badge** from the menu.
3. In the **Set badge** modal, select a badge to apply to the document, then add a note about the badge (optional).
