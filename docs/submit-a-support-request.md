# Submit a support request

When [live chat](/docs/sigma-support#contact-sigma) is unavailable, or if you prefer to receive support communications via email, you can submit a support request in Sigma's support portal.

1. Go to [support.sigmacomputing.com](https://support.sigmacomputing.com/) and click **Submit a request**, or [click here](https://support.sigmacomputing.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?) to open the form directly.

   If you're not currently logged into your Sigma Support account, submit your credentials to access the form.

   >
   > Your Sigma Support account is separate from your Sigma app account and may have been created during customer onboarding. If you cannot sign in and don't receive a password reset email after submitting a **Forgot password** request, you might not have an existing Sigma Support account. To request one, contact your Sigma Account Manager.
2. Complete the **Submit a request** form:

   1. [optional] In the **CC** field, enter additional email addresses that should receive a copy of the request and all responses. The email address associated with your Sigma Support account is automatically saved as a recipient.
   2. In the **Subject** field, enter a brief summary of your request.
   3. In the **Description** field, describe the issue and include relevant information (for example, the error message and ID) that can enable the Support team to quickly and easily assist you.
   4. Click the **Severity** field and select an option from the dropdown:

      |  |  |
      | --- | --- |
      | * **S3** (low) | General product questions and feature requests. |
      | * **S2** (medium) | Specific product functionality is degraded and affects a small number of users. |
      | * **S1** (high) | Sigma service or performance is severely degraded for one or more product components and affects business processes. |
      | * **S0** (critical) | Sigma service is inaccessible for one or more major product components and affects crucial business processes. |

      > ðŸš§
      >
      > A request submitted with the **S0** (critical) severity level immediately alerts the on-call Support engineers, regardless of day or time. Please select this severity level only if your issue meets the criteria.
   5. [optional] In the **Attachments** section, add relevant files that can help the Support team better understand the issue.
   6. Click **Submit**.
