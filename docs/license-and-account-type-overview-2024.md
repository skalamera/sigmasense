> ### If your organization utilizes the View/Act/Analyze/Build license model, refer to [this account type and license overview](/docs/license-and-account-type-overview).

Account types and licenses are foundational components of Sigmaâ€™s user management and pricing structure. Account types enable the selection of granular permissions that determine how users access and interact with data and documents in Sigma. The selected permissions determine the account typeâ€™s license tier used for billing purposes.

This document outlines Sigma's license tiers and explains the relationship between account types and licenses. It also provides a comprehensive comparison of permissions that determine which license is assigned to each account type.

For information about using account types, see [Create and manage account types](/docs/create-and-manage-account-types-2024). For information about license pricing, contact your Account Executive or Customer Success Manager.

## License tiers

Sigma offers three license tiers that support different service levels to accommodate your organizationâ€™s diverse user requirements and access control policies. The following table describes model users and key capabilities of each license tier.

## License tiers

The three license tiers provide different levels of service to accommodate your organizationâ€™s diverse user requirements and access control policies.

### Lite license

The Lite license is suitable for report consumers who require access to prepared data and insights. This license tier allows members to view shared datasets, explorations, and workbooks. Lite-licensed members also have access to baseline interactions in explorations and workbooks, including the ability to update control values, sort column data, view aggregated underlying data, create saved views, and ask natural language queries with Ask Sigma.

### Essential license

The Essential license is ideal for decision-making data consumers who require more deep-dive capabilities in published workbooks but donâ€™t need to build workbooks themselves. This license tier includes all Lite license capabilities while also allowing members to drill into unaggregated underlying data, contribute to input tables, download workbook content, and schedule exports and alerts.

### Pro license

The Pro license is designed for data architects, BI analysts, and report builders who model, transform, and analyze data. This license tier offers the full range of Sigma features and capabilities, including the ability to create and manage datasets, data models, and workbooks. The Pro license also supports system administrators who manage organization settings and members.

## Account type and license relationship

Account types enable admin users to select granular permissions that determine which features and capabilities organization users can access. Sigma automatically assigns a license to each account type based on the highest license tier of the enabled permissions. This relationship allows for more flexible and scalable access control that adapts to ongoing changes in your user base and user requirements.

The following table compares the account type permissions associated with each license tier. When configuring an account type, admins can enable or disable any combination of permissions within and across license tiers.

1Access to individual connections are determined by [data permissions](/docs/data-permissions-overview).

2Access to individual datasets, data models, and workbooks are determined by [folder and document permissions](/docs/folder-and-document-permissions).

3For a comprehensive comparison of user capabilities, see [Basic explore vs. Full explore](/docs/basic-explore-vs-full-explore).

4Enables the ability to add and view comments for all license tiers. Also enables screenshot capture and annotation in comments for Essential and Pro licenses only.

5AI features such as Ask Sigma, explain charts with AI, and the AI-powered formula assistant require an AI provider to be configured for the organization. See [Configure an AI provider](/docs/configure-ai-features-for-your-organization#configure-an-ai-provider).
