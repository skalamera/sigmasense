# Export to email

# Export to email

You can send workbooks, their pages, and individual elements to email recipients on a set schedule or as-needed basis.Â For example, you can email an executive team member a PDF file of the team's KPIs on a regular basis.

You can set multiple export schedules for a workbook. Each email that you send can include multiple attachments as long as the total attachment size is below the [export limit](#export-limit).

Sigma generates exports from the workbook's latest published version. Changes you make to a workbook draft, custom view, or exploration cannot be exported unless you save or publish the changes. Depending on your export destination, you can also choose to export a saved view or tagged version of the workbook. If you are exporting elements that are only on a saved view, you must open the export modal from the saved view.

For a matrix of supported file formats and saved view/version tag export support, see [Available export destinations and formats](/docs/send-or-schedule-workbook-exports#available-export-destinations-and-formats).

## User requirements

* To export data to email, you must be assigned an [account type](/docs/license-and-account-type-overview) with the **Export to email** permission enabled.
* To set up an email export to run queries as the recipients, your account type must also have the **Run exports as recipient** permission enabled.
* To send a version-tagged workbook, the version tag must exist and be applied to the workbook. Admins can create a version tag, and workbook creators can tag a version of a workbook. For more information, see [Version tagging](/docs/version-tagging).

> If your organization restricts email traffic sent from specific IP addresses, add `198.37.153.185` and `134.128.103.81` to the allowlist. Alternatively, you can configure a custom SMTP server to use instead. See [Custom SMTP server](/docs/customize-welcome-and-invite-emails#custom-smtp-server).

## Export limit

The size limit for emailed exports is 30MB. This is the total limit for all attachments when combined.

If an export exceeds this limit, the entire export fails and the owner of the scheduled export is notified. Scheduled exports that repeatedly exceed this limit are automatically paused and their owner notified.

See [Download, export, and upload limitations](/docs/download-export-and-upload-limitations).

## Export to email as needed

To send an ad hoc email export:

1. From the workbook menu (![](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Icons/caret.svg)), select **Share and export> Export...**.

   > ðŸ“˜
   >
   > ### If the export to email option is not available, the workbook is in **Edit** mode. Either publish your draft or return to the latest published or tagged version of the workbook before attempting to export to email.
2. Select **Email**.
3. In the **Recipient** field, enter one or more comma-separated Sigma teams, Sigma users, or email addresses. You can email up to 1,000 recipients unless you use the **Run queries as recipient** setting.

   > ðŸ“˜
   >
   > ### If export authentication is configured for your organization, you can only send the export to email addresses associated with an authorized domain. When you attempt to send the export, Sigma notifies you if an email address contains a domain that is not allowed. An admin can change this setting. See [Restrict export recipients](/docs/restrict-export-recipients).
4. (Optional) In the **Subject** field, enter a subject line.
5. (Optional) In the **Message** field, enter a message.
6. If the workbook has version tags or bookmarks, select which one you want to send.
7. In the **Attachment** section, choose what you want to export as an attachment. You can export:

   * An **Entire workbook** and export all workbook pages.
   * A specific workbook page, by navigating to the workbook page and choosing **Entire page**.
   * An element on a specific workbook page, by navigating to the workbook page and choosing the name of the element.

   Select **+ Add** to add more attachments.
8. For each attachment, select a supported file format. For a matrix of supported file formats, see [Available export destinations and formats](/docs/send-or-schedule-workbook-exports#available-export-destinations-and-formats).
9. (Optional) By default, Sigma includes a link to the workbook in the email body. If you don't want to include a link, deselect the **Include link to workbook** checkbox.
10. (Optional) By default, an export captures data accessible to the export creator. To limit the export to only what the recipient has permission to access, select the checkbox for **Run queries as recipient**. If you do not see the checkbox, your account type might not be assigned the **Run exports as recipient** permission.

    > ðŸš©
    >
    > ### **Run queries as recipient** only succeeds if you email 300 or fewer recipients and all of the recipients are Sigma users. If you enable this option and not all recipients are Sigma users, the email fails to send. The sender of the export receives a failure notification email with the error message: "No users found in organization for the provided email recipients".

    > ðŸ’¡
    >
    > ### When an export is run as recipient, each query runs separately per recipient. Larger recipient lists result in more queries sent to the database and longer processing times.
11. (Optional) Depending on the attachment formats that you select, you can configure more options like combining attachments, sending attachments in a zip file, and more, See [Configure additional options for exports](/docs/configure-additional-options-for-exports).
12. Click **Export**.

## Schedule an emailed export
