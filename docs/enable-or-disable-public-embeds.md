# Enable or disable public embeds

Public embedding allows you to display workbooks and data elements in other internal- or external-facing applications. Public embeds are enabled for your organization by default, but you can disable them in the **Administration** portal.

This document explains how to enable or disable public embeds for your organization. For information about using public embeds, see [Create a public embed](/docs/create-and-manage-a-public-embed).

## User requirements

To enable or disable public embedding, you must be assigned the **Admin** [account type](/docs/user-account-types).

1. Go to **Administration** > **Account** > **General Settings**.

   1. In the Sigma header, click your user avatar to open the user menu.
   2. Select **Administration** to open the **Administration** portal.
   3. In the side panel, select **Account**, then open the **General Settings** tab.
