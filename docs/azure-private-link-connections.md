# Azure Private Link Connections

# Azure Private Link Connections

This document explains how to connect Sigma to your data warehouse that's hosted on Azure using Azure's Private Link.

> ðŸ“˜
>
> ### See Sigma's [Azure Private Link](https://quickstarts.sigmacomputing.com/guide/administration_azure_private_link/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) lab for more information on how to establish a secure connection between Sigma and an Azure data warehouse.

## Requirements

* A Sigma organization running on Azure.
* You must be assigned the Admin [account type](/docs/create-and-manage-account-types) in your Sigma organization.
* Snowflake, Databricks, PostgreSQL or MySQL Admin, depending on the data warehouse.
* Be an Admin in Azure.

## Introduction

Sigma organizations running on Azure can securely connect to their data using Azure's Private Link, which allows Sigma to access the data warehouse hosted on Azure via a private endpoint in the virtual network. This not only enhances security during data transit but also improves performance by reducing network latency. With Private Link, Sigma connects to the data warehouse using private IP addresses, ensuring traffic never leaves the Microsoft network and data remains secure without exposure to the internet.

To utilize Private Link, create a private endpoint in your virtual network that maps to the data warehouse, assign it a private IP address, and connect to the warehouse using this address.

Sigma supports connections to the following data warehouses on Azure:

* [Snowflake](#snowflake)
* [Databricks](#databricks)
* [PostgreSQL](#postgresql)
* [MySQL](#mysql)
* [Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, or SQL Server 2022](#azure-sql-database-azure-sql-managed-instance-or-sql-server-2022)

## Create Private Link connection for your data warehouse

Follow the steps below to create a Private Link connection to your data warehouse hosted in Azure.

> ðŸ“˜
>
> ### To initiate this process, the first step for all data warehouses is to retrieve the required information and send to your account manager.

## Snowflake

> ðŸ“˜
>
> ### As of September 16, 2025, new Private Links to Snowflake will require a private link to a [Snowflake internal stage](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/private-internal-stages-azure). Existing Azure Private Links created before September 16, 2025 will not require an additional internal stage Private Link. If you want to add a private link to a Snowflake internal stage and already have an Azure Snowflake private link set up with Sigma, see [Add a Private Link to a Snowflake internal stage](#add-a-private-link-to-a-snowflake-internal-stage).

Creating an Azure Private Link to Snowflake is a multi-step process:

1. [Configure your Snowflake internal stage](#step-1-configure-your-snowflake-internal-stage)
2. [Provide Snowflake information to Sigma](#step-2-provide-snowflake-information-to-sigma)
3. [Configure your Snowflake connection in Sigma](#step-3-configure-snowflake-connection-in-sigma)

### Step 1: Configure your Snowflake internal stage

Sigma requires all Azure Private Links created after September 16, 2025 to also include a link to a [Snowflake internal stage](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/private-internal-stages-azure).

Configure your internal stage in Snowflake by running the following commands in your Snowflake console:

```
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;  
ALTER ACCOUNT SET ENABLE\_INTERNAL\_STAGES\_PRIVATELINK \= true;
```

See the Snowflake documentation on [Configuring private endpoints to access internal stages](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/private-internal-stages-azure#configuring-private-endpoints-to-access-snowflake-internal-stages) for more information.

### Step 2: Provide Snowflake information to Sigma

> ðŸ“˜
>
> ### Your Snowflake account must be Business Critical Edition to use Private Link.

Follow the steps below to provide Sigma with the requisite information to create a Private Link for your organization.

1. In your Snowflake console, run the following command:

```
select key, value from table(flatten(input=>parse_json(system$get_privatelink_config())));
```

2. In the output field, copy the values for `privatelink-pls-id`, `private-account-url`, `privatelink-internal-stage` and `ResourceID`:

   * The `private-pls-id` may be formatted similarly to: `Sf-pvlinksvc-<region>.<id>.<region>.azure.privatelinkservice`
   * The `private-account-url` may be formatted similarly to `<account_id>.<region>.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com`
   * The `privatelink-internal-stage` may be formatted similarly to `/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/sfc-prod-storage/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<internal_stage_id>`
   * The ResourceID of the internal stage storage account is defined by the `privatelink-internal-stage` key.
3. Contact your Sigma account manager and provide:

   * The `privatelink-pls-id` value
   * The `private-account-url` value
   * The `ResourceID` defined by the `privatelink-internal-stage` key
4. Sigma will create a Private Link and notify you when the link is active.
5. After the Private Link to internal stage has been created, you will need to approve the endpoint request in Snowflake. Call the `SYSTEM$AUTHORIZE_STAGE_PRIVATELINK_ACCESS` function by running the following in your Snowflake console:

```
select system$authorize_stage_privatelink_access('<Sigma_Private_Endpoint_ID>');
```

Use the `Sigma_Private_Endpoint_ID` provided to you by your Sigma account manager.

See the Snowflake documentation on [SYSTEM$AUTHORIZE\_STAGE\_PRIVATELINK\_ACCESS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_authorize_stage_privatelink_access) for more information.

Once your Private Link is active and you have approved the internal stage endpoint request, follow the steps to configure your Snowflake connection in Sigma.

### Step 3: Configure Snowflake connection in Sigma

Follow the steps below to configure your Sigma Snowflake connection to use Private Link. You can only complete these steps once your Private Link is active.

1. After the private link is active, in Sigma, go to **Admin > Connections > Snowflake**.
2. Click **Create** to create a Snowflake connection.
3. In the **Account** field, enter the three parts of the account URL in this format: `<account>.<region_id>.privatelink`

   For example, if the account URL is:

   `test123.west-us-2.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com`

   The **Account** field is `test123.west-us-2.privatelink`
4. Under **Warehouse,** enter your warehouseâ€™s name as listed in Snowflake.
5. If you have OAuth enabled on your organization, and you would like to use it on the connection, switch on OAuth access; see [Connect to Snowflake with OAuth](/docs/connect-to-snowflake#connect-to-snowflake-with-oauth).
   *Please note: Steps 9 - 11 are not applicable if you choose to use OAuth without a service account.*
6. Under **User,** enter your Snowflake username.
7. Under **Password**, enter your Snowflake password.
8. [optional] For **Role**, you can specify a Snowflake role to be used on this connection.

   ![company apps](https://files.readme.io/fd91793-2.png)
9. [optional] For **Connection Features**,Â you can set a connection timeout and/orÂ [enable write access](/docs/set-up-write-access).
10. After completing the form, click **Create**.

### Add a Private Link to a Snowflake internal stage

If you have an existing Azure Snowflake Private Link and want to create a private link to a [Snowflake internal stage](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/private-internal-stages-azure), follow the steps below:

1. Enable the internal stage in Snowflake by running the following command in your Snowflake console:

   ```
   USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
   ALTER ACCOUNT SET ENABLE_INTERNAL_STAGES_PRIVATELINK = true;
   ```
2. Obtain the `ResourceID` of the internal stage storage account defined by the `privatelink-internal-stage` key from your Snowflake console, by running the following command:

   ```
   select key, value from table(flatten(input=>parse_json(system$get_privatelink_config())));
   ```

The `ResourceID` may be formatted similarly to `/subscriptions/XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX/resourceGroups/sfc-prod-storage/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/XXXX`.

3. Contact your Sigma account manager and provide them with the `ResourceID`.
4. Sigma will contact you once the new Private Link has been created, and provide you with a `Sigma_Private_Endpoint_ID` (which is the `ResourceID` of a Sigma-owned private endpoint).
5. After the Private Link has been created, you will need to approve the endpoint request in Snowflake. Call the `SYSTEM$AUTHORIZE_STAGE_PRIVATELINK_ACCESS` function by running the following in your Snowflake console:

   ```
   select system$authorize_stage_privatelink_access('<Sigma_Private_Endpoint_ID>');
   ```

Use the `Sigma_Private_Endpoint_ID` provided to you by your Sigma account manager.

See the Snowflake documentation on [SYSTEM$AUTHORIZE\_STAGE\_PRIVATELINK\_ACCESS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_authorize_stage_privatelink_access) for more information.
