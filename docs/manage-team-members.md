# Manage team members

# Manage team members

You can add and remove users from teams or transfer a user to another team at any time in order to control access to folders, documents, and data for multiple users at the same time. To allow for collaboration and sharing across teams, you can make users members of multiple teams at the same time. When a user is a member of a Sigma team, they automatically inherit all access and permissions granted to that team.

This document explains how to add, remove, and transfer members to and from teams in Sigma. For information about creating teams and assigning team admins, see [Create and manage teams](/docs/manage-teams) and [Manage team admins](/docs/manage-team-admins).
