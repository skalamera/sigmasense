# Create and manage workbook themes

Create and manage reusable workbook themes in the **Administration** portal. Customize fonts, colors, layout style, and table style, then assign your organization's default theme.

## User requirements

To create and manage workbook themes, you must be assigned an [account type](/docs/create-and-manage-account-types) with the **Manage all workbook themes and fonts** or **Manage branding settings** permission enabled.

## Theme settings overview

Customize any of the following theme settings to meet branding and aesthetic requirements.

### Color

The **Color** settings control text, button, background, element, and chart colors in a workbook.

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Appearance** | Select between a  **Light** or  **Dark** theme for a workbook. |

## Change the default theme

The **Default** marker in the list of custom themes indicates your organization's default. If no default marker is displayed, your organization's default is Sigma's built-in **Light** theme.

   * To assign the theme as your organization's default, select **Set as default**.
   * To unassign the theme as your organization's default, select **Remove as default**.
