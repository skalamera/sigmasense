# Export to Microsoft SharePoint

To send documents, reports, and data to a Microsoft SharePoint site, schedule or set up an export. When you [export to Microsoft Teams](/docs/export-to-microsoft-teams) , the exported file is also stored in the SharePoint site associated with the Team. You can also send files directly to a SharePoint folder.

Export an element, a workbook page, or an entire workbook to Microsoft SharePoint.

Sigma generates exports from the workbook's latest published version. Changes you make to a workbook draft, custom view, or exploration cannot be exported unless you save or publish the changes. Depending on your export destination, you can also choose to export a saved view or tagged version of the workbook. If you are exporting elements that are only on a saved view, you must open the export modal from the saved view.

For a matrix of supported file formats and saved view/version tag export support, see [Available export destinations and formats](/docs/send-or-schedule-workbook-exports#available-export-destinations-and-formats).

This documentation describes how to send and schedule exports to Microsoft SharePoint.

## User requirements

The ability to export to Microsoft SharePoint requires the following:

* The [Microsoft integration](/docs/manage-microsoft-integration) must be added for your organization.
* One Sigma organization can only connect to one Microsoft organization, but you can share to any SharePoint site within the Microsoft organization.
* You must be assigned an [account type](/docs/license-and-account-type-overview) with the **Export to Microsoft Teams and SharePoint** permission enabled.

Any files added from Sigma appear as modified by the SharePoint App.

## Prerequisites

You must know the URL of the SharePoint folder that you want to export to. To copy a link to a SharePoint folder, click **Copy Link** or navigate to **Share> Copy Link**.
