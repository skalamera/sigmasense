# Text elements

Text elements add labels, headers, footers, and titles to workbook pages. They can be formatted to change their color and font and can also display text dynamically using a formula.

## User requirements

To add and edit text elements:

* You must have **Can edit** or **Can explore** [access](/docs/folder-and-document-permissions#document-permissions) to the individual workbook.
* You must be in **Edit** or **Explore** mode for the workbook. See [workbook modes overview](/docs/workbook-modes-overview).

## Create a text element

To add a text element to a workbook:

1. In the **Add element** bar, select **UI** > **Text**. The new text element appears on the page.
2. Begin typing to enter text.
3. (Optional) Use the toolbar at the top of the page to add custom formatting or select ![](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Icons/link.svg) **Link** to add hyperlinks.
4. (Optional) Drag and drop the text element to move it anywhere on the page canvas.

## Apply formatting to a text element

To change the color, font, or other formatting of the text element:

1. Select the text you want to format.
2. Use the toolbar at the top of the page to select your format option(s).

## Add dynamic text based on your data

When editing a workbook, you can inject dynamic text into text elements. Dynamic text is text generated based on a formula. This is helpful if you want to display element headers or inline text that automatically updates based on your data.

1. Select your text element, and position your cursor where you would like to add dynamic text.
2. Press **=** on your keyboard or click the function (![](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Icons/function.svg)) button located in the workbook's toolbar.  
   A formula bar pops up over your text element.
3. Type a formula, just as you would in the formula bar of any data element. Start typing the name of the object or table with your desired field, and Sigma will provide suggestions for you to choose from.
4. Press **Enter** on your keyboard to see the resulting dynamic text.
5. (Optional) To apply formatting:
   1. Select your new dynamic text.
   2. Choose a format option from the toolbar.
