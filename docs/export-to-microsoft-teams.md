# Export to Microsoft Teams

To send documents, reports, and data to Microsoft Teams, schedule or set up an export to Microsoft Teams from Sigma. You can export to any public channel in a team.

Two buttons appear, one with an option to Open File, and another to Open in Sigma.](https://files.readme.io/f1b5cf15dfd239d686f83a85f696e4f4f289dba4ffa03192a33c9092c8a73580-teams-export-border-small.png)

Export an element, a workbook page, or an entire workbook to Microsoft Teams.

Sigma generates exports from the workbook's latest published version. Changes you make to a workbook draft, custom view, or exploration cannot be exported unless you save or publish the changes. Depending on your export destination, you can also choose to export a saved view or tagged version of the workbook. If you are exporting elements that are only on a saved view, you must open the export modal from the saved view.

For a matrix of supported file formats and saved view/version tag export support, see [Available export destinations and formats](/docs/send-or-schedule-workbook-exports#available-export-destinations-and-formats).

This documentation describes how to send and schedule exports to Microsoft Teams.

## User requirements

The ability to export to Microsoft Teams requires the following:

* The [Microsoft integration](/docs/manage-microsoft-integration) must be set up for your organization.
* The Sigma Notifications app [must be added to the first named channel of your team](/docs/manage-microsoft-integration#add-the-sigma-notifications-app-to-teams).

  > ðŸ“˜
  >
  > The first named channel is the first channel named when creating a team. It might also be called the "General" channel or the home channel, and can be renamed. See [Edit a channel in Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/edit-a-channel-in-microsoft-teams-3497a0d0-5cae-44be-8a57-0d75b48da859).
  >
  > To identify the first named channel for a team, navigate to your team in the Teams sidebar, then choose **More Options** > **Manage Team**. The channel with a house icon next to it is the first named channel.
* You must be assigned an [account type](/docs/license-and-account-type-overview) with the **Export to Microsoft Teams and SharePoint** permission enabled.

## Export size limit

The size limit for exports to Microsoft Teams is 1GB per file. See [Download, export, and upload limitations](/docs/download-export-and-upload-limitations).

## Send an ad hoc notification to a Microsoft Teams channel

To send an ad hoc notification to a Microsoft Teams channel, the Sigma Notifications app must be added to the first named channel of the Team. The channel that you share to must be standard or shared.

Each message is from the Sigma Notifications bot and includes **New Export** and the title of the workbook and element being shared.

1. From the workbook menu , select **Share and export> Export...**.
2. Select **Microsoft Teams**.
3. In the **Channel URL** field, enter the URL of the Microsoft Teams channel. For example, `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/<channel-ID-and-name>?groupId=<group-ID>&tenantId=<tenant-ID`
