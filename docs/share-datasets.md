# Share datasets

You can share a Sigma dataset with other people in your organization.

The document’s owner or the organization's administrator can share, modify, or revoke access permissions for Sigma documents.

## Permission types

Datasets support two permission types: [Can View](/docs/share-datasets) and [Can Edit](/docs/share-datasets), with the following granted privileges on shared documents. For more details, see [Folder and document permissions](/docs/folder-and-document-permissions).

* View, create a copy, and [Send and schedule exports from workbooks](/docs/send-and-schedule-exports-from-workbooks)
* You can use datasets as data sources for workbooks or other datasets.
* All [Can View](/docs/share-datasets) privileges
* Edit, publish, and share
* Can manage content, including the ability to delete, move, or rename.

## Respond to a request for access to content

If a user attempts to access your content and doesn't have permissions to do so, they can request access through the error page blocking their immediate access. This triggers a Request to Access email notification.

To respond to the Request for Access, do the following:

1. In the email notification, click the **Respond to the Request** button.
2. Sigma opens with the Share Dataset modal, allowing you to view the current access requests. Optionally, click the permission drop-down menu to select the level of access the user should have.  
   ***Note:** The user cannot be granted access higher than what their account type allows.*

3. If desired, click **Approve**. If Approve is selected, the request is removed from the Share Dataset modal, and the user is listed in the Who Has Access tab.
