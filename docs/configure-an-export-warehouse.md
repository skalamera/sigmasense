# Configure an export warehouse

An export warehouse is a virtual warehouse in Snowflake created specifically for running Sigma exports.

By default, Sigma sends export queries to your connectionâ€™s primary warehouse, but you can configure it to run all scheduled, direct, and on-demand exports through a separate export warehouse. This practice isolates export operations to optimize performance and reduce computing costs.

This document explains how to configure an export warehouse in Sigma.

## System and user requirements

The ability to configure an export warehouse in Sigma requires the following:

* Your Sigma organization must have an existing [Snowflake connection](/docs/connect-to-snowflake).
* You must be assigned the **Admin** [account type](/docs/user-account-types).

## Prerequisites

Before you configure an export warehouse in Sigma, you (or another user with appropriate Snowflake permissions) must create a separate virtual warehouse dedicated to running export queries in Snowflake. For more information about this process, see [CREATE WAREHOUSE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-warehouse) in Snowflakeâ€™s documentation.

## Configure an export warehouse

Enable Sigma to use the dedicated export warehouse by configuring your Snowflake connection accordingly.

1. Go to **Administration** > **Connections**:

   1. In the Sigma header, click your user avatar to open the user menu.
   2. Select **Administration** to open the **Administration** portal.
   3. In the side panel, select **Connections**.
2. In the **Connections** page, select the Snowflake connection to which you want to add an export warehouse.
3. In the connection overview, go to the **Connection Details** section and click **Edit**.

4. In the **Connection Features** section, locate the **Export Warehouse** field and enter the name of the virtual warehouse created for export queries.

5. Click **Save** to run all scheduled, direct, and on-demand exports through the specified warehouse.
