## Contact Sigma

The Sigma team is here to support you every step of the way. While the live chat platform is the best method of reaching a Support Engineer, there are several ways to get in contact with Sigma:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Live chat** | Chat with a Support Engineer in real time.  During Sigma's business hours (Monday through Friday, 2:00 am to 6:00 pm PT, except [holidays](#holiday-schedule)), agents typically respond within one minute. Outside business hours, agents respond to high-severity issues within 30 minutes. All other issues are addressed when business hours resume.  To contact Sigma via chat, open the  **Help** menu in your Sigma account, then select **Live chat** and click **Send us a message**.  Live chat is available in English only. |
| **Escalations** | You can also use live chat to escalate a critical issue.  For information about escalation criteria and best practices, see [Escalate critical issues](/docs/escalate-critical-issues). |
| **Office hours** | Schedule a 30-minute Zoom session with an experienced Support Engineer to cover your questions about select topics, like embedding, authentication, input tables, and more.  [Click here](https://calendly.com/sigma-support) to schedule office hours. You can also access Sigma's scheduling page directly in your Sigma account. Open the  **Help** menu in your Sigma account, then select **Live chat** and click **Sigma Support Office Hours**. |
| **Support request** | Submit a support request to receive email responses from a Support Engineer.  For more information about filling out the request form, see [Submit a support request](/docs/submit-a-support-request). |
| **Community** | Ask questions, share knowledge, and interact with Sigma staff and other members of the [Sigma Community](https://community.sigmacomputing.com/). |
