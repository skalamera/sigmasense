> ### If your organization utilizes the View/Act/Analyze/Build license model, refer to [this document](/docs/create-and-manage-account-types).

Account types enable you to manage user access to specific features and capabilities available through each license tier. Default and custom account types add flexibility and scalability to Sigmaâ€™s access control methodology, allowing your organization to adapt to ongoing changes in your licensed user base and user requirements.

This document introduces default and custom account types and explains how to create, manage, and assign account types to organization users. For more information about account types as they relate to the licensing model, see [License and account type overview](/docs/license-and-account-type-overview-2024).

## User requirements

To create and manage account types and user assignments, you must be assigned the Admin account type.

## Default and custom account types

Sigma supports default and custom account types that allow you to enable or disable any combination of permissions within the constraints of your organizationâ€™s license tiers.

For a comparison of available account type permissions by tier, see [Account type permission availability matrix](/docs/license-and-account-type-overview-2024#account-type-permission-availability-matrix).

### Default account types

There are four default account types built into your organization: Lite, Essential, Pro, and Admin. These account types reflect Sigma's [license tiers](/docs/license-and-account-type-overview-2024) and support four standard roles or levels of access.

| Default account type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Lite** *(Lite license)* | Enables all permissions available through the Lite license tier.  *Recommended for users who require access to prepared data and insights.* |
| **Essential** *(Essential license)* | Enables all permissions available through the Essential license tier.  *Recommended for users who require more deep-dive capabilities in published workbooks but donâ€™t need to build workbooks themselves.* |
| **Pro** *(Pro license)* | Enables a selection of permissions available through the Pro license tier.  *Recommended for users who model, transform, and analyze data.* |
| **Admin** *(Pro license)* | Enables all permissions available through the Pro license tier and administrative privileges.  *Recommended for system administrators who manage organization settings and users.* |

### Custom account types

Custom account types allow you to create additional roles and variations of access within any license tier. You can enable or disable individual permissions for granular access control that suits any user of your organization.

## Create and manage account types

The following procedures demonstrate how to create, edit, and delete account types. These tasks involve the account type details and permissions only.
