# Enable or disable comments

Commenting is enabled by default and available for all workbooks. See [Workbook comments](/docs/workbook-comments).

If you disable commenting, Sigma also disables its [image annotation feature](/docs/annotate-element-images-as-comments).

## Requirements

* You must be an [organization admin](/docs/user-account-types) to disable comments across your organization.

## Disable comments

1. [Open your Admin Portal.](/docs/sigma-administration)
2. On the **Account** page, find the **Features** section, and click the toggle switch located to the right of **Comments**.
