# Workbook settings overview

You can configure workbook settings that apply to all pages and elements in a workbook. These settings allow you to customize your workbook to best fit your project, brand, and analyses. Within settings, you can:

* Change your [workbook theme settings](/docs/workbook-settings-overview#theme-settings), [color settings](/docs/workbook-settings-overview#color-settings) and [font settings](/docs/workbook-settings-overview#font-settings) to match company or project branding
* Modify your [layout style](/docs/workbook-settings-overview#access-workbook-settings) and [layout settings](/docs/workbook-settings-overview#layout-settings) to accommodate differently sized pages or screens
* Edit [table style settings](/docs/workbook-settings-overview#table-style-settings) to highlight important information
* [Manage workbook locales](/docs/workbook-settings-overview#manage-locales) to translate your workbook

This document explains how to access your workbook settings, and what options are available for configuration.

For more information on designing workbook layouts, see [Design workbook layouts](/docs/design-workbook-layouts).
