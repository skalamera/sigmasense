# Respond to account upgrade requests

Users can request an account upgrade when attempting to create or explore a workbook. When a user submits an account upgrade request, all Sigma admins in the organization receive an email.

As a Sigma admin, you can approve or deny account upgrade requests. For more details about license types and account types, see [Account type and license overview](/docs/account-type-and-license-overview).

For more details on when users can submit an account upgrade request, see [About upgrade requests](/docs/license-upgrade-requests#about-upgrade-requests).

If you don't want users to be able to request upgrades, see [Enable or disable account upgrade requests](/docs/license-upgrade-requests#enable-or-disable-upgrade-requests).

If SCIM is configured, any account type changes you make in the Sigma UI are overridden by your SCIM configurations. See [Manage users and teams with SCIM](/docs/manage-users-and-teams-with-scim).
