## AI features overview

Sigma provides several AI-powered features to help you work more efficiently with your data:

* Native natural language query interface: Ask Sigma.
* For builders, Formula Assistant and AI Queries to get help and leverage LLMs in analysis and app building.
* For consumers, use AI to understand visualizations.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use AI features, a user assigned the Admin account type must:

1. Configure an AI provider (warehouse AI models, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, or Gemini models).
2. Enable the appropriate permissions for your account type.
3. Set up highlighted data sources for Ask Sigma.

For detailed setup instructions, see [Configure AI features for your organization](/docs/configure-ai-features-for-your-organization).

## Getting started with Ask Sigma

Ask Sigma allows you to query your data using natural language. Simply type questions like "What were our top selling products last month?" and get instant insights. Ask Sigma serves as a starting point to help you understand the data within your organization.

You can use Ask Sigma to:

* Ask questions about your data in natural language.
* Get instant AI-generated responses and visualizations.
* Explore data through interactive charts and tables.
* Refine and iterate on your questions for better insights.

For more information, see: [Ask natural language queries with Ask Sigma](/docs/ask-natural-language-queries-with-ask-sigma)

## Perform queries with AI

Beyond Ask Sigma's natural language interface, you can also run AI queries directly from your cloud data warehouse. If your data warehouse includes SQL functions for generative AI models (like Snowflake Cortex, Databricks AI functions, or BigQuery ML), you can call these functions from Sigma to perform advanced AI operations on your data.

Use AI queries to:

* Analyze sentiment in text data.
* Classify content or data points.
* Extract key information from unstructured text.
* Generate summaries or insights from large text fields.

For more information, see: [Perform AI queries](/docs/perform-ai-queries)

## Using the formula assistant

The formula assistant helps you create and understand formulas more efficiently.

Use the formula assistant to:

* **Write formulas**: Describe what you want to calculate, and AI will suggest the appropriate formula.
* **Fix errors**: Get help correcting formula syntax and logic issues.
* **Explain formulas**: Understand what existing formulas do in plain language.

For more information, see: [Use AI with formulas](/docs/use-ai-with-formulas)

## Explaining charts with AI

Get instant insights about your visualizations with AI-powered chart explanations.

Use the Explain this chart feature to:

* Generate instant AI-powered descriptions of your visualizations.
* Understand patterns and trends in your data.
* Get contextual insights about chart performance.
* Receive explanations in plain language.

For more information, see: [Explain charts with AI](/docs/explain-visualizations-with-ai)
