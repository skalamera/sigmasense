> ### If your organization utilizes the Lite/Essential/Pro license model, refer to [this document](/docs/create-and-manage-account-types-2024).

Account types enable you to manage user access to specific features and capabilities available through each license tier. Default and custom account types add flexibility and scalability to Sigmaâ€™s access control methodology, allowing your organization to adapt to ongoing changes in your licensed user base and user requirements.

This document introduces default and custom account types and explains how to create, manage, and assign account types to organization users. For more information about account types as they relate to the licensing model, see [License and account type overview](/docs/account-type-and-license-overview).

## User requirements

To create and manage account types and user assignments, you must be assigned the Admin account type.

## Default and custom account types

Sigma supports default and custom account types that allow you to enable or disable any combination of permissions within the constraints of your organizationâ€™s license tiers.

For a comparison of available account type permissions by tier, see [Account type permission availability matrix](/docs/account-type-and-license-overview#account-type-permission-availability-matrix).

### Default account types

There are five default account types built into your organization: *View*, *Act*, *Analyze*, *Build*, and *Admin*. These account types reflect Sigma's [license tiers](/docs/account-type-and-license-overview#license-tiers) to support five standard roles or levels of access.

| Default account type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| View | Enables all *View* permissions.  *Recommended for users who need access to prepared data and insights.* |
| Act | Enables all *View* and *Act* permissions.  *Recommended for users who need to input and update data* |
| Analyze | Enables all *View*, *Act*, and *Analyze* permissions.  *Recommended for users who require more deep-dive capabilities without building workbooks themselves.* |
| Build | Enables all *View*, *Act*, and *Analyze* permissions and a selection of *Build* permissions.  *Recommended for users who model, transform, and analyze data.* |
| Admin | Enables all *View*, *Act*, *Analyze*, and *Build* permissions, plus administrative privileges.  *Recommended for system administrators who manage organization settings and users.* |

### Custom account types

Custom account types allow you to create additional roles and levels of access. You can enable and disable any combination of permissions to suit the needs of your organization users.

## Create and manage account types

The following procedures demonstrate how to create, edit, and delete account types. These tasks involve the account type details and permissions only. For information about assigning account types to users, see [View and manage account type assignments](#view-and-manage-account-type-assignments) in this document.

### Create a new custom account type

   2. Select **Administration** to open the **Administration** portal.
   3. In the side panel, select **Account types**.

      >
      > ### To select all permissions associated with the *View*, *Act*, *Analyze*, or *Build* license tier, select the checkbox in the applicable column header.

      Sigma automatically assigns a license to the account type based on the highest license tier of the enabled permissions. You can view the assigned license next to the account type name and description.
