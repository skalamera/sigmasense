# Dynamically assign roles used by a connection

You can dynamically assign a role for a specific user or team of users to use in a new or existing connection that supports it based on the value of an assigned user attribute.

> This feature isn't supported by all data platform connections. To check if your connection supports it, see [Supported data platforms and feature compatibility](/docs/region-warehouse-and-feature-support#supported-data-platforms-and-feature-compatibility).

Use a dynamically assigned role to manage user access for a variety of use cases, such as assigning the role that a team of embed users should use to access securely embedded content. By using more than one role on your connection, you can take advantage of the row-level security defined in your data platform rather than manually recreating row-level security and security policies in Sigma.

After you configure attributes on the connection, you can also assign the attribute to external embed users in a secure embed URL. For more details, see [Restrict access to data in embedded content](/docs/restrict-access-to-data-in-embedded-content).

> ### For Snowflake connections, you can also dynamically assign a virtual warehouse with a `Warehouse` user attribute. Dynamically assigning a warehouse lets you manage compute costs separately for each customer, for example, if you securely embed Sigma.

## Requirements

You must be assigned the Admin [account type](/docs/user-account-types).

You also must ensure that your data platform is set up to support this configuration:

* Each role must be granted to the user or user account associated with the connection.
* Each role must be granted privileges or permissions to use the relevant database objects.
* If you dynamically assign a warehouse for Snowflake, the Snowflake role to be used with a specific warehouse must be granted at least the USAGE privilege on the warehouse.

## Configure user attributes

To set user attributes on a connection, you must first create and assign a `Role` user attribute to the relevant users and teams of users.

1. Create a `Role` user attribute. Set a default value equivalent to a suitable default role in your data platform configuration.
2. Assign the `Role` user attribute to users and teams. Set the value of the user attribute to the role name that you want each team or user to use when accessing data.

> ### The same steps apply for the `Warehouse` attribute.

For instructions, see [Configure user attributes](/docs/user-attributes).

## Set user attributes on a connection

After you create and assign a user attribute to users and teams, configure a new or existing connection to use the user attributes:

1. Follow the steps to create a connection for your data platform:

   * [Snowflake](/docs/connect-to-snowflake#create-a-snowflake-connection-in-sigma)
   * [PostgreSQL](/docs/connect-to-postgresql)
2. (Snowflake only) In the **Connection Credentials** section, for the **Warehouse** field, select **Set by user attribute** to browse and select the `Warehouse` attribute that you previously configured.
3. In the **Connection Credentials** section, for the **Role** field, select **Set by user attribute** to browse and select the `Role` attribute that you previously configured.
4. Finish setting up your connection. When you create or save your connection, the changes take effect.
