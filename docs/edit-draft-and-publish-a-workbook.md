# Draft and publish a workbook

# Draft and publish a workbook

When you edit a workbook, you create a draft. To make the changes visible to users with view access and explore access to the workbook, publish the draft. You can also choose to discard your draft, and return to the previously published version.

If multiple users edit a workbook at the same time, the edits are automatically saved to a shared, live draft. Multiple editors can collaborate on this single draft in real time. See [Collaborate with Live Edit in workbooks](/docs/workbook-collaboration-with-live-edit).

This document describes how to edit drafts, publish workbooks, and update workbook metadata.

## Requirement

* To draft and publish new workbook versions, you must have **Can edit** [access](/docs/folder-and-document-permissions#document-permissions) to the individual workbook.

## Edit an existing workbook

To begin editing an existing workbook from view mode, click **Edit** in the workbook header.

To begin editing an existing workbook from a custom view, click the document menu, then click **Edit** > **Edit workbook**.

After the workbook enters edit mode, the workbook header changes:

* The **Edit** button changes to a **Publish** menu.
* The document menu is appended to include **Draft**.
* The header displays the initials of any other users currently in edit mode. See [Collaborate with Live Edit in workbooks](/docs/collaborate-with-live-edit-in-workbooks).

In addition, when a workbook enters edit mode:

* The editor panel appears on the right side of the page.
* The **Add element bar** appears at the bottom of the canvas.
* The footer shows additional options.

## Making changes in edit mode

Changes you make to the draft automatically save to the live draft shared by all editors.

When an editor clicks **Publish**, Sigma publishes all drafted changes, including changes drafted by other editors on the live draft.

## Preview drafted changes

You can preview all drafted changes in both explore and view modes prior to publishing. This is helpful if you want to see what a workbook will look like to users with view access or explore access to the workbook.

To preview drafted changes:

1. Click the caret to open the **Publish** menu.
2. Under **Preview with**, select either **View access** or **Explore access**.

![Screenshot showing the Publish menu open and the mouse hovering over Preview with Explore access.](https://files.readme.io/e4a61181ae8c22271793328436260066c80e4517a15849c462af0aaee39906c0-preview-with-explore.png)

3. When finished previewing, click **Exit preview**.

## Publish drafted changes

To publish your edits, click the **Publish** button located in the workbook header.

![Screenshot of the mouse hovering over the Publish button.](https://files.readme.io/425a499069dbf1dd267baf2fd2e98f6bda0c7591ab76eafbdfe0bf215761cf85-click-publish.png)
  

This action publishes all drafted changes to the workbook, including changes made by other editors using the live draft.

## Discard drafted changes

To discard your drafted changes, click the caret to open the **Publish** menu, then click **Discard draft**.

![Screenshot of the Publish menu open and mouse hovering over Discard draft.](https://files.readme.io/81b32e254bd7f2bf7f6505ce26cd116d8dae4a62f2820a46084698b44b0b19b7-discard-draft.png)
> ðŸš§
>
> ### When any editor discards a draft, Sigma discards all unpublished edits made by any editor.

## Return to the latest published version

To return to a workbook's latest published version, click the caret to open the **Publish** menu, then click **Go to published version**.

![Screenshot of the Publish menu open and mouse hovering over Go to published version](https://files.readme.io/3a00de808cd3a355d3c599ff30335dcf113581d15a26e114291a7cd14d0990b9-go-to-published.png)

Sigma does not discard your drafted changes. You can return to the shared draft at any time by clicking the published version's **Edit** button.
