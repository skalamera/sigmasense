# Use comments in workbooks

# Use comments in workbooks

You can add comments to workbooks and data models, including individual elements, to provide context for charts or control elements, solicit feedback from colleagues, or make requests. When you comment on a workbook or data model, an email is sent to all editors of the document that have previously published a version.

When you add comments, make sure that your workbook is published or saved. If you want to add comments to an exploration, you must first save the exploration as a new workbook. If you add comments to a custom view of a workbook, merge your changes into the workbook or save your custom view before commenting.

## User requirement

To view and add comments in workbooks, you must be assigned an [account type](/docs/create-and-manage-account-types) with the **Can comment on workbooks** permission enabled.

## View comments

To see comments on a workbook or data model, click the document name, then in the document menu, select **Comments**.  
A panel opens and displays all comment threads.
