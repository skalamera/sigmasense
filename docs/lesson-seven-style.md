# Lesson seven: Style

Welcome to lesson seven: Style.

In the last lesson, we organized our workbook around a clear user experience and a design thatâ€™s easy to maintain.

Now, letâ€™s focus on the layout and style of our workbook by implementing layout elements, as well as workbook themes.

This lesson covers the following Sigma features:

* Image elements
* Container elements
* Layout elements
* Workbook settings
* Themes
* Account types and permissions

## Layout

Letâ€™s take a final pass through our workbook pages to polish the layout, and learn about a few more Sigma elements we can use to organize workbook contents.

1. To start, navigate to the **Departure Delay vs Arrival Delay** page.
2. From the **Add element** bar, select **UI** > **Image**.

![In the add element bar, a user selects UI and then selects Image](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tutorials/docs-fundamentals/L7/L7_1.png)

Image elements can be used to display an image file. You can download this symbol for the Federal Aviation Administration to test this out.

3. Right-click this image and select **Save Image Asâ€¦**

![The icon of the Federal Aviation Administration](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tutorials/docs-fundamentals/L7/L7_2_faa_icon.png)

4. Give the file a name, and save it to a location of your choice.
5. Navigate back to your workbook page. Select **Add Image** on the image element, and select your image from the file browser.

![A user selects the Add image option from the center of an image element](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tutorials/docs-fundamentals/L7/L7_3.png)

6. The image element populates with the FAA icon.
7. Move the image element to the top of the page. Then, select the image element, the two KPI elements, two filter control buttons, and the text element that displays our filter values by using `shift+click`, `ctrl+click` (`cmd+click` on Mac), or click and drag.
8. With all these elements selected, select ![](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Icons/container.svg) **Create container**.

![With the FAA icon, KPI elements, button elements, and text element selected, a user selects the Create container option](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tutorials/docs-fundamentals/L7/L7_4.png)

This creates a container element surrounding the selected elements.

Containers are a layout element. In this case, we created a container by selecting multiple elements and using the **Create container** menu option. However, you can also create an empty container by selecting it from the **Layout** section of the **Add element** bar.

> ðŸ’¡
>
> #### When should I use a layout element?
>
> Each layout element has its own use case. Containers are useful for making clear groups of elements, or for styling multiple elements at once, but they arenâ€™t always the best option. We saw in our last lesson that a modal was the obvious choice for content that needs to be globally accessible.
>
> When selecting a layout element, consider the user experience.
>
> Imagine a scenario where youâ€™ve made a dashboard with a line chart showing daily sales over the course of the quarter. You get a request from management to add in lines for net profit and sales quantity. Instead of adding multiple lines representing different measures to the same chart, you might decide to use a tabbed container to show each of these different measures in separate charts viewed in the same place in the dashboard.
>
> Consider why this might be the best option when it comes to using the available space most efficiently.

![A user selects Layout from the element bar, and then selects Container](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tutorials/docs-fundamentals/L7/L7_5.png)

Containers offer two main advantages:

* **Grouping**: Because containers surround the selected elements, they make an obvious visual grouping that can be used to separate distinct groups of elements from one another. In this case, weâ€™ve separated controls, images, and text from the various charts on our workbook page.
* **Style**: Containers offer style options for the spacing between elements, as well as background color and padding, which allows us to style multiple elements as a group, or to style our workbook page with multiple background colors.

9. Select the remaining elements on the workbook page (bar chart, line chart, and two pivot tables) and create a container around them as well.

![The workbook page is divided into two containers, visually separating the options and headlinin information from charts](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tutorials/docs-fundamentals/L7/L7_6.png)

10. To finish the layout and style of this page, implement the following small changes:

* Set the **Size** of the **Set Filters** and **Clear Filters** buttons to **Large** in the **Properties** panel
* Change the name of the KPI elements to **Average Departure Delay** and **Average Arrival Delay**, and add units (minutes) to each
* Create a new text element, and add it to the container with the image element. Enter the phrase `All delay times listed in minutes`, and italicize it
* Rework some of the spacing and arrangement in the top container to make it presentable
* Select the line chart **Average Departure and Arrival Delay by Week**. In the editor panel, select **Format** and open the **Legend** section. Turn the **Show legend** toggle off.
* Select the bar chart Average of Departure and Arrival Delay by Airline. In the editor panel, select Format and open the X-axis section. Change the orientation to 0 degrees.

The **Departure Delay vs Arrival Delay** page now looks like the screenshot below:

![The workbook page, separated into two containers, has some small style adjustments made for legibility](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tutorials/docs-fundamentals/L7/L7_7.png)

Now, letâ€™s turn our attention to styling the **Arrival Delay by Delay Type** page.

1. Navigate to **Arrival Delay by Delay Type**.
2. Add a copy of the image element with the FAA icon we added to the **Departure Delay vs. Arrival Delay** page.
3. Add a copy of the text element with the disclaimer `All delay times listed in minutes.`
4. Organize the page so that it roughly mirrors the **Departure Delay vs. Arrival Delay** page. In the example below, we opted to use a container in the top-left corner of the page to show buttons, text, the FAA logo, and the unique filter for this page. The donut chart is placed in the top-right corner, and the line chart runs horizontally along the length of the page below them.

![The workbook page is divided into three containers, with context and options in the top-left quadrant, a donut chart in the top-right, and a line chart spanning the bottom of the page](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tutorials/docs-fundamentals/L7/L7_8.png)

These placements compliment the shapes of these two charts, helping keep them legible. If we were to swap them, the line chart would appear squashed, and the donut chart would be far too large compared to the rest of the workbook contents.

5. To finish the layout and style of this page, implement the following small changes:

* Set the **Size** of the **Set Filters** and **Clear Filters** buttons to **Large** in the properties panel.
* Update the `All delay times listed in minutes` text to read `All delay times listed in minutes. Delay breakdowns are only available for flights with 15 minutes or more of total Arrival Delay`
* Rework some of the spacing and arrangement in the top container
* On the **Clear Filters** button for this page and in the **Filters** modal, add a **Clear control** action that clears the **Total Arrival Delay** range slider control.
* In the dynamic text element that displays **Filter** selections, add a line for `Total Arrival Delay Length:` and press `=` on your keyboard to configure the following formula for it: `If((([control-total-arrival-delay].min = 15) and ([control-total-arrival-delay].max = 1971)), "Any", (Text([control-total-arrival-delay].min) & " to " & Text([control-total-arrival-delay].max)))`

> ðŸ’¡
>
> #### How would I write this formula on my own?
>
> Weâ€™ve provided some rather long formulas in this course to help simplify the building process. What resources are available to help write complicated formulas on our own?
>
> In the documentation, you can refer to the [function index](/docs/function-index) to see available functions by type.
>
> Alternatively, you can consult the [formula assistant](/docs/use-ai-with-formulas), an AI tool that can write or explain formulas.
>
> In the case of this specific formula, consulting the documentation for the [If function](/docs/if) helps explain the structure.
>
> The goal for this formula is to provide text that describes the current delay duration weâ€™ve filtered to.
>
> * In the first argument - `(([control-total-arrival-delay].min = 15) and ([control-total-arrival-delay].max = 1971))` - we declare a condition to check if both the min and max values of the control are set to the extreme values.
> * In the second argument, we put the result to return if the first condition is met. In this case, since the flight duration hasnâ€™t been filtered at all, we return the string `Any`
> * In the third argument, we specify what to return if the condition in the first argument is not met. In this case, we return `(Text([control-total-arrival-delay].min) & " to " & Text([control-total-arrival-delay].max)))` which reads the current minimum and maximum values from the control, converts them to text, and concatenates them with â€œ to â€œ in between them.

The **Arrival Delay by Delay Type** page now looks like the screenshot below:

![The Arrival Delay by Delay Type page appears with changes for legibility and style](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tutorials/docs-fundamentals/L7/L7_9.png)

Now both of our dashboard pages are standardized and organized.

## Workbook themes

In the last section, we reviewed style at the level of individual elements. We organized elements into containers, changed sizes, and added images. These small changes are important to the final product, but theyâ€™re not holistic in the same way as other design choices we could make. Letâ€™s explore workbook themes to make universal style changes quickly.

1. Navigate to the **Departure Delay vs Arrival Delay** page.
2. Click on the background of the workbook page. Note that container element backgrounds are not the same as the background of the workbook. You can tell that youâ€™ve clicked on the background when the editor panel shows options for the page, rather than any individual element.

![In the editor panel, the Workbook settings option appears](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tutorials/docs-fundamentals/L7/L7_10.png)

3. Open the **Theme** dropdown menu and select **Dark**.

The workbook changes to **Dark**, a pre-configured workbook theme. The background turns black, text turns white, and other elements, like the **Set Filter** button, change to shades of blue that compliment the new black background.

4. Open the **Theme** dropdown and select **Light**.

Themes are a powerful tool for styling one or more workbooks quickly. In the rest of this section, letâ€™s configure a custom theme that we can apply to this workbook as well as other workbooks for our organization. In the future, we wonâ€™t have to configure the theme. Weâ€™ll be able to select it from the dropdown menu.

![In the Theme dropdown, a user selects the FAA Data Theme option](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tutorials/docs-fundamentals/L7/L7_11.png)

1. Click the **Workbook settings** button.
2. Open the **Color** section.
3. Open the **Highlight** color picker.

![The color options show choices for Text, Highlight, and Surface](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tutorials/docs-fundamentals/L7/L7_12.png)

4. Select the dropper icon to **Pick a color**.
5. Using the color picker, hover over the green of the FAA logo, and click to select it as the **Highlight** color.

![Using the color picker, a user selects the green color from the FAA logo](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tutorials/docs-fundamentals/L7/L7_13.png)

6. Open the **Canvas** color picker. Click to edit the six-digit hex code for the canvas and enter `D4D4D4`.

![In the color picker for the canvass, a user enters the hex code D4D4D4](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tutorials/docs-fundamentals/L7/L7_14.png)

7. Close the **Color** section and open the **Font** section.
8. Set the **Text font** and **Data font** to **Nunito**. For **Title font**, select **Bold**.

![The Text font and Data font show the Nunito font selected. The title font has the Bold option highlighted](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tutorials/docs-fundamentals/L7/L7_15.png)

9. Close the **Font** section and open the **Layout style** section.
10. Set **Page width** to **Large** and **Spacing** to **Small**.
11. Close the **Layout style** section and open the **Table style** section.
12. Set the following Table style settings:

* For **Preset**, select **Presentation**.
* For **Cell spacing**, select **Medium**.
* For **Grid lines**, select **No grid**.
* Under the **Subheade**r tab, select **Center align** for both the **Row header** and **Column header**.
* Under the **Cell** tab, select **Center align**.

These changes demonstrate some of the ways we can style our workbook with themes. You might notice that some of our previous choices, like the colors in our charts, donâ€™t compliment the theme well. In the future, we might want to apply a theme like this at the beginning of our workbook creation process. That way, we can make design choices about individual elements with our overall theme in mind. Letâ€™s round out this lesson by learning how to save and reuse a theme in future workbooks.

To complete the next step, you must be assigned an [account type](/docs/create-and-manage-account-types) with the **Manage all workbook themes and fonts** permissions enabled.

13. In the **Settings** panel, open the **Theme** dropdown menu and select **Save custom themeâ€¦**

![In the Theme dropdown menu, a user selects the Save custom theme option](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tutorials/docs-fundamentals/L7/L7_16.png)

14. In the menu, enter **FAA Data Theme** as the name for the theme. Then, click **Save**.

> ðŸ’¡
>
> #### Do I have permission to do this?
>
> You might not have the necessary permissions to [save your current workbook settings as a theme](/docs/create-and-manage-workbook-themes#user-requirements) available to all users in your organization. In this case, you can only access this feature if your account type has the **Manage all workbook themes and fonts** permission enabled.
>
> Permissions in Sigma are based on account types. Each account type has several different permissions granted to it, which are controlled by admins. There are multiple default account types, but administrators can also select unique permissions to [create custom account types](/docs/create-and-manage-account-types).
>
> Because custom account types offer so much flexibility, it might not always be obvious from your account type alone if you have permission to access a feature. You can always check the **User requirements** section of a feature in the documentation to identify the name of the permission your account type must have.

15. Click **Publish** to save your work to the published version.

## Conclusion

At the end of lesson seven, weâ€™ve styled individual elements along with our dashboard as a whole. Our pages share a standard layout and theme.

To do that, we learned about the following:

* Image elements
* Container elements
* Layout elements
* Workbook settings
* Themes
* Account types and permissions
