# SumIf

# SumIf

The **SumIf** function adds the numbers in a column if all the conditions are true for that row.

> ### This function must be used with aggregated data in a grouped table. For a detailed video walkthrough that uses this function, see [Building complex formulas with grouped data](https://www.sigmacomputing.com/resources/training-videos/table-grouping-and-functions#complex-formulas).

## Syntax

`SumIf(field, condition 1, [condition 2], ...)`

Function arguments:

* **field** (required) - The column of numbers to add together. Null values are skipped.
* **condition 1** (required) - The logical condition that returns a result that is either True or False. If the condition is True, the number on the corresponding row is added to the sum. Note: you can use [operators](/docs/operators-overview) in conditions.
* **condition 2 +** (optional) - Additional conditions can be added after the first condition.

> ðŸ“˜
>
> In the case of multiple conditions the "AND" logical operator is used by default. In order to use an "OR" operator the conditions should be encapsulated in a single condition chained by an explicit "OR."
