# DateLookback

# DateLookback

The **DateLookback** function returns the value of a variable at a previous point in time (or lookback period) determined by a specified date and offset.

> ðŸ“˜
>
> ### DateLookBack() can only be used on a grouped column where the grouping is simple DateTrunc(). If the grouping includes additional non-date columns, or if the grouping includes additional logic such as a fiscal year calculation, use a Lookup() instead. For an example of using Lookup() for this use case, see [Why doesnâ€™t DateLookback work when Iâ€™m using custom fiscal years/quarters?](https://community.sigmacomputing.com/t/why-doesn-t-datelookback-work-when-i-m-using-custom-fiscal-years-quarters/3845) in our Community site.

## Syntax

```
DateLookback(value, date, amount, period)
```

Function arguments:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **value** | (required) | The value to look up.  Can be a column to reference, a formula to compute, or a constant.  When referencing a column, the data must contain unique period values or be aggregated at the same date granularity as the period argument. Non-unique period values can result in null or multiple values output. |
| **date** | (required) | The date to reference when offsetting the lookback period.  Can be a date, date column, or formula that returns a date. |
| **amount** | (required) | The number of periods to offset the lookback period.  Can be a positive integer (for lookback) or negative integer (for lookahead). |
| **period** | (required) | The unit of time to use for the offset and lookback period.  Can be `"year"`, `"quarter"`, `"month"`, `"week"`, `"day"`, `"hour"`, `"minute"`, or `"second"`. |

## Example

A table includes an *Annual Gross Profit* column containing the gross profit for each year between 2019 and 2023. You can use the **DateLookback** function to return the previous yearâ€™s gross profit and facilitate a period-over-period analysis.

```
DateLookback([Annual Gross Profit], [Year], 1, "year")
```

The formula determines a one-year offset from the period in the *Year* column, then references the offset period and returns the corresponding value from the *Annual Gross Profit* column.
