## Learn to build in Sigma

Fundamentals for Builders is a tutorial series that helps build a solid foundation in Sigma, using hands-on learning.

This course is specifically designed for new users in Sigma with a [Build license](/docs/account-type-and-license-overview), who want to construct dashboards, reports, and data apps. It’s suitable for those with minimal BI experience, but also for experienced users looking to gain familiarity with Sigma’s features and workflows.

This course doesn’t focus on administration or under-the-hood technical details.

Sigma designed this course with a focus on learning and comprehension, so that you can work with comfort and fluency in Sigma, and maximize its features when building dashboards and data apps.

## What you’ll do

In this course, you’ll build an interactive dashboard in Sigma, using provided sample data and step-by-step instructions.

At the end of this course, you’ll have a dashboard on US domestic flight delay times, built off of real-world flight data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States. The dashboard utilizes tables, calculations, charts, maps, interactive components, and more to give you a holistic, hands-on introduction to Sigma.

It will look something like the gif below:

By the time you finish building, you’ll have hands-on experience with the following:

* Connecting to data
  + You’ll add data from a connected data platform, and manipulate it with tables, pivot tables, groupings, formulas, joins, unions, and more.
* Visualizations
  + The course introduces you to several chart types like bar, line, donut, and map charts in Sigma. You’ll learn how to configure charts, and how to easily create filters that apply globally.
* User experience
  + In later lessons, you’ll use controls, actions, and layout elements, as you consider how best to design an intuitive user experience. This includes configuring an input table for user data entry.

You’ll also learn how to apply these skills outside of this sample use case. Throughout the course, look for callouts that explain how you can use features in other contexts.

Happy building!
