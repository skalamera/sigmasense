# Using CSVs in Datasets

# Using CSVs in Datasets

You can upload CSV data to a dataset in Sigma. When you upload a CSV, Sigma stores a copy of the CSV directly in your data warehouse. As such, this functionality must be enabled on both your organization and individual warehouse connection by an organization admin.

## System and user requirements

The ability to upload CSV data to a dataset requires the following:

* The [**CSV upload** feature](/docs/enable-csv-upload) must be enabled for your organization.
* You must be assigned an [account type](/docs/license-and-account-type-overview) with the **Upload CSV** permission enabled.
* You must be the dataset owner or be granted **Can edit** [dataset permission](/docs/folder-and-document-permissions).

## CSV data storage

When a CSV file is uploaded to Sigma, its data is **automatically written back to your data warehouse** as a new table. If your organization has multiple warehouses with write access enabled, you will be given the option to select a single destination.

CSV data stored in your warehouse is **only accessible through the dataset created during file upload**. You will not see it listed as a Table in the connection. The CSV dataset can however, be [joined to other data](/docs/join-types) stored in the same warehouse.

> ### You cannot append additional data to an existing CSV upload. To update the dataset, [replace the CSV data source](#replace-an-existing-csv).

## CSV deletion

If the dataset referencing the uploaded CSV is deleted from Sigma, the associated table created in your warehouse will automatically be removed within 24 hours.
