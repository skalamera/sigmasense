# Share a folder

You can categorize and share documents with people using folders. You share folders with other users and teams by granting access to the folder. Folders support four levels of access permissions:

* **Can view**
* **Can explore**
* **Can contribute**
* **Can manage**

This document describes folder permissions and how to share folders. For more details on available permissions, see [Folder and document permissions](/docs/folder-and-document-permissions).

## User requirements

The ability to share a folder requires the following:

* You must be assigned an [account type](/docs/license-and-account-type-overview) with the **Share documents** permission enabled.
* You must be the folder owner or be granted **Can manage** [access to the folder](/docs/folder-and-document-permissions#folder-permissions).

## Permission types

Permission options are the same for folders and workspaces. Permissions set at the folder or workspace level apply to all documents within that workspace or folder.

| Permission | Folder access and capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| **Can view** | * View-only access to documents and folders in the shared space |
| **Can explore** | * Explore access to workbooks in the shared space * View-only access to all datasets in the shared space |

## Respond to request for access to content

If a user attempts to access your content and doesn't have permissions to do so, they can request access through the error page blocking their immediate access. This sends an email notification with the subject **Request for access** to the owner of the folder.

To respond to the request for access, do the following:

1. In the email notification, click **Respond to the request**. The **Share Folder** modal opens, allowing you to view the current access requests.
2. (Optional) Use the dropdown menu to set the user's level of access.

   > ðŸ“˜
   >
   > ### The user cannot be granted access higher than what their account type allows.
3. Approve or deny the request:

   * To approve the request, click **Approve**. The request is removed from the **Share Folder** modal, and the user is listed in the **Person or team with access** tab.
   * To deny the request, click **Deny**. The request is removed from the **Share Folder** modal.
4. Close the **Share Folder** modal. The access that you granted or denied is saved after selecting **Approve** or **Deny**.
