> Geography functions aren't compatible with all data platform connections. To check if your connection supports these functions, see [Supported data platforms and feature compatibility](/docs/region-warehouse-and-feature-support#supported-data-platforms-and-feature-compatibility).

Geography functions enable you to work with the [geography data type](/docs/data-types-and-formats#geography) to analyze locations, routes, and other geospatialÂ data.Â For example, you can use geography functions to transform data into compatible formats for [geography maps](/docs/build-a-geography-map).
