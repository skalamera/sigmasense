# Create a workbook

Workbooks are a Sigma document type designed to support both ad hoc data exploration and complex long-term reporting. Creating a workbook allows you to add [data, UI and control elements](/docs/intro-to-element-types), [customize your workbook layouts](/docs/design-workbook-layouts), [add charts](/docs/intro-to-visualizations), [build data apps](/docs/data-apps), [add embedded analytics](/docs/intro-to-embedded-analytics), and more.

Unpublished workbooks are referred to as "explorations".

This document covers how to create a new workbook or exploration. For a conceptual overview of workbooks, see [Workbooks overview](/docs/workbooks-overview). For more details about using and navigating a workbook, see [Navigate a workbook](/docs/navigating-a-workbook).

## User requirements

* To create a workbook or exploration, you need the **Create, edit, and publish workbooks** permission. See [Account type and license overview](/docs/account-type-and-license-overview).

## Create a workbook or exploration

You can create a workbook or exploration from several places:

> ðŸ“˜
>
> Explorations can be accessed from the Sigma home page for 30 days after creation. See **Recent** > **Explorations**.

### Create from the Sigma home page

1. Select ![](https://sigma-docs-screenshots.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Icons/button-add.svg) **Create New**, then select **Workbook**. A new exploration appears.
2. After making your changes, select **Publish** to save the exploration as a workbook.

### Create from a data source

You can create workbooks from data sources (such as tables from your data platform):

1. From your data source, select **Explore**. A new exploration appears.
2. After making your changes, select **Publish** to save the exploration as a workbook.

### Create from an existing workbook

You can create a copy of an existing workbook:

1. From your desired workbook, select the document menu.
2. Select **File** > **Save as a new workbook**.
3. Enter a name for the workbook and select **Save**.
4. After making your changes, select **Publish** to save the exploration as a workbook.

### Create from a template

Templates allow you to reuse and share specific workbook structures for quick and consistent reporting. See [Create workbooks from templates](/docs/create-workbooks-from-templates).
