> ### The [percentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile) is a number between 0 and 1. The last row is always 1 and the first is 0, unless there is only 1 row or there is a tie for the top value. To display the result as percentages as opposed to numbers, change the column formatting from Automatic to Percent.

## Example

`RankPercentile([Population by State])`

* This assigns the state with the smallest population rank 0, the largest population is assigned rank 1.
