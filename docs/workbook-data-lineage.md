# View workbook and data model data lineage

Data lineage refers to the ancestry and relationships between data elements in a workbook or data model. All workbooks and data models contain a *lineage graph*, allowing you to review and navigate the relationships and dependencies in the document.

Some use cases for data lineage include:

* Determining how changes to a data element might affect any child elements
* Determining the source of unexpected data
* Cleaning up existing workbooks to remove unused or redundant elements
* Diagnosing the source of data and/or permission errors
* Identifying dependencies for materialization schedules

This document describes how to view and navigate the data lineage for a workbook or data model.

## Requirements

* To view data lineage, you must have **Can Edit**Â [access](/docs/folder-and-document-permissions) to the workbook or data model.

* Fit the lineage graph to your browser window view.
* Select the **Show controls** checkbox to show or hide control elements.
* Move around the graph using your cursor to grab and drag.
* Reorganize elements in the graph by clicking and dragging. Any changes you make to element position are reset when you close the data lineage.
* [Focus your lineage view on a specific element or page](#focus-your-lineage-view-on-a-specific-element-or-page) .
* [Open an element from data lineage](#open-an-element-from-data-lineage) .
