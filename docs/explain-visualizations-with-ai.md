# Explain charts with AI

The **Explain this chart** feature uses AI to instantly generate a description of any chart. Details can include key insights, observations, data distribution summaries, and other context that can enhance your understanding of visualized data and help drive informed decisions.

This document introduces AI-generated explanations for charts and explains how to access and utilize the feature.

## System and user requirements

The ability to explain a chart with AI requires the following:

* The [OpenAI integration](/docs/manage-external-ai-integrations#add-the-openai-integration) must be configured for your organization.
* If using Azure OpenAI, the [GPT-4.1 model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-models/concepts/models-sold-directly-by-azure?pivots=azure-openai&tabs=global-standard-aoai%2Cstandard-chat-completions%2Cglobal-standard#gpt-41-series) (`gpt-4.1-2025-04-14`) or later must be configured in the OpenAI integration.
* You must be assigned an account type with the **Explain charts with AI** permission enabled.

## About AI-generated explanations

When you use the **Explain this chart** feature, Sigma captures a snapshot of the chart and passes this image, along with the chartâ€™s underlying data, to your OpenAI model. The model then processes the information and analyzes the context to generate an explanation of the data visualized by the chart. Sigma presents this explanation and allows you to provide feedback about the results, which can be used to improve future responses.

For information about how your data is secured and stored when using AI features, see [Frequently asked questions](/docs/manage-external-ai-integration#frequently-asked-questions) in [Manage external AI integrations](/docs/manage-external-ai-integration).
