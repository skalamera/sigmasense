# Manage organization locale

# Manage organization locale

Admins can specify an organizationâ€™s locale by going to **Administration > Account > General Settings > Locale**.

Setting the locale allows you to serve the Sigma users in your organization and consumers of embedded analytics with content in their preferred language.

## Requirements

* You must be assigned the **Admin** [account type](/docs/user-account-types).

## Set the organization locale

Sigma supports five locales that you can set as the base locale for your Sigma organization:

* English (United States): `en`
* English (United Kingdom): `en-gb`
* English (Australia): `en-au`
* English (Canada): `en-ca`
* English (Ireland): `en-ie`

The default locale is English (en). For example, when you switch to the English (United Kingdom) (en-gb) locale, dates display as DD/MM/YYYY or Day Month Year, and time displays in the 24-hour format.

To change the organization locale:

1. Go to the **Administration** > **Account** > **General Settings** tab.
2. Under Locale, click **Edit**.
3. Use the drop-down menu under **Account Locale** to select your preferred locale.
4. Click **Save**.
