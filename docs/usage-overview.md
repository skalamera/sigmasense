# Usage overview

# Usage overview

All organizations in Sigma automatically receive a set of Sigma-built Usage dashboards. The Usage dashboards provide measurable insights into how your organization uses Sigma in the form of detailed tables and charts representing your organizationâ€™s usage trends, query statistics, document access changes, and much more. You can download this data and the associated charts for later use.

## User requirements

* You must have an Admin account type or have a custom account type that has the **View usage dashboard** permission enabled. For more information, see [Create and manage account types](/docs/user-account-types).

## Usage reports

| Report | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Users | Explore user status, view account and license type breakdowns, track user engagement and activity, and view insights into your organizationâ€™s teams. |
| Document activity | Discover your organizationâ€™s most commonly used documents and which users are accessing them the most. You can use these insights to audit unused documents and identify documents that drive the most user engagement. |
| Document permissions | Discover who has permission to a document, permission origins, access type, and which users have changed access types for other users. You can use these insights to help monitor access type changes for security purposes. |
| Exports | View data about your organizationâ€™s top exporting users and browse a list of your most commonly exported documents, including instances of both on demand and scheduled exports, to gain insight into what is being shared the most externally and by what users or teams. |
| Materializations | Explore materialization statistics, including materialization failure rates and runtimes, and browse a list of each of your documents that use materializations. Keep track of your organization's materializations with a detailed log of all materializations created and used by your organization. |
| Queries | View detailed data and insights about your organizationâ€™s queries. Explore statistics about success and timeout rates, runtimes, query types, and much more. Discover users and documents that run the most queries and gain insight into popular times and days for certain queries. Track your organizationâ€™s queries with a detailed log of all queries and relevant information. |
| Embedding | View public embedding and application embedding (legacy) usage for your organization. Secure embeds are not tracked. Users are tracked using the `external_user_id` or, when available, `email` from the embed URL. |

## Save a custom view

You can customize your view of a usage dashboard and save it for future use. This allows you to change the colors, truncations, filters, groupings, and more of the existing usage dashboards. Or, you can even create new dashboards and charts using the usage dashboard data and save them in a custom view you can return to at any time.

To create and save a custom view of a usage dashboard:

1. Open the usage dashboard you wish to create a custom view for.
2. Click **Customize** to open a custom view. The editor panel opens.
3. Customize a data element's formatting, change one of its properties, apply a filter, or add a new element to change the dashboard from its original state.
4. Click **Custom view** and then select **Custom views** > **Save this custom view...**

   The **Save view** modal opens.

5. In the **Save view** modal, enter a name for the saved view.
6. (Optional) Check the checkbox for **Set as default view** to save this view as the default view.
7. Click **Save** to save the custom view for other users to access.
