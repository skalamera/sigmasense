Sigma webhook exports let you send data to your own webhook endpoints, or to other applications such as Marketo, Segment, or Airtable, using a webhook. You can export your workbook data on an as-needed basis or create one or more schedules for recurring exports. Each schedule can support multiple endpoints and send conditions.

Sigma generates exports from the workbook's latest published version. Changes you make to a workbook draft, custom view, or exploration cannot be exported unless you save or publish the changes. Depending on your export destination, you can also choose to export a saved view or tagged version of the workbook. If you are exporting elements that are only on a saved view, you must open the export modal from the saved view.

For a matrix of supported file formats and saved view/version tag export support, see [Available export destinations and formats](/docs/send-or-schedule-workbook-exports#available-export-destinations-and-formats).

## User requirements

The ability to export to webhooks requires the following:

* You must be assigned an [account type](/docs/user-account-types) with the **Export to webhook** permission enabled.

> ### If your organization restricts traffic from certain IP addresses, add the Sigma IP addresses to your allowlist. For more details, see [Add Sigma IPs to the allowlist](/docs/connect-to-data-sources#add-sigma-ips-to-the-allowlist).

## Supported formats

Individual elements can be exported to webhook as the following file types:

* CSV
