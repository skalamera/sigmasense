# Sigma's sample connection

When you create your Sigma organization, we automatically connect you to our sample warehouses. These Snowflake and Databricks connections, named *Sigma Sample Database* and *Sigma Sample Catalog* respectively, provide a variety of accessible data to jumpstart your first time Sigma experience.

## Example workbooks

Every Sigma user is provided a set of example workbook templates upon signup. All examples are built on data in the **Sigma sample connection**.  You can view these examples in your **Templates** gallery. See [Get started with workbook templates](/docs/get-started-with-workbook-templates).

## Create a workbook from sample data

Creating a workbook from Sigma’s sample connection will give you a taste of what it will be like to use your own data in Sigma; see [Create a workbook](/docs/create-a-workbook).

## Hide the sample connection

Organization admins can hide the Sigma sample connection for their organization. Organization members will not see it listed in the connection list. However, content built on top of the sample connection will still be visible and usable.

1. [Access your Administration Portal](/docs/sigma-administration).
2. In the side panel of the **Administration** Portal, select **Account**.
3. Under the **Features** section, turn on the toggle next to **Sample connection**.
