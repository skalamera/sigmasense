App-based authentication allows users to authenticate to Sigma using dedicated mobile or desktop applications for two-factor authentication. This authentication method provides a streamlined experience for users accessing Sigma through native applications.

App-based authentication provides enhanced security by:

* Eliminating reliance on third-party services, removing a single point of failure.
* Being invulnerable to delivery issues like spam filters as app codes are generated locally on the userâ€™s device.
* Providing a true second factor by requiring possession of a separate device or app to generate authentication codes.

> You can still use email verification codes as an authentication option instead of app-based authentication if you or your users have lost access to the device with the authenticator app.

## Requirements

Any user can set up app-based authentication if their organization uses passwords to authenticate. Admin account type users can reset app-based authentication for users in their organization.

1. In the Sigma header, click your user avatar and select **Profile**.
2. Select **Enroll app** for the **Set up authenticator app** option.
3. Scan the QR code with the authenticator app on your mobile device, or enter the code manually.
4. Enter the 6 digit code generated by the authenticator app.
5. Click **Verify**.

## Disable app-based authentication

1. In the Sigma header, click your user avatar and select **Profile**.
2. Select **Disable** for the **Set up authenticator app** option.
3. Click **Disable**.

## Reset app-based authentication

Admin account type users can reset app-based authentication for any user in their organization:
