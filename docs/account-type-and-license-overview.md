Account types and licenses are foundational components of Sigmaâ€™s user management and pricing structure. Account types enable the selection of granular permissions that determine how users access and interact with data and documents in Sigma. The selected permissions determine the account typeâ€™s license tier used for billing purposes.

This document outlines Sigma's license tiers and explains the relationship between account types and licenses. It also provides a comprehensive comparison of permissions that determine which license is assigned to each account type.

For information about using account types, see [Create and manage account types](/docs/create-and-manage-account-types).

## License tiers

Sigma offers four license tiers that support different service levels to accommodate your organizationâ€™s diverse user requirements and access control policies. The following table describes model users and key capabilities of each license tier.

## Account type and license relationship

Account types enable admin users to select granular permissions that determine which features and capabilities organization users can access. Sigma automatically assigns a license to each account type based on the highest license tier of the enabled permissions. This relationship allows for more flexible and scalable access control that adapts to ongoing changes in your user base and user requirements.

> ### If your organization utilizes the Lite/Essential/Pro license model, refer to [this account type permission availability matrix](/docs/license-and-account-type-overview-2024#account-type-permission-availability-matrix).

The following table compares the account type permissions associated with each license tier. When configuring an account type, admins can enable or disable any combination of permissions within and across license tiers.
