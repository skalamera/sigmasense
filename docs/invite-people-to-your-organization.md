# Invite new users to your organization

You can invite new members to your organization from the **Administration** portal. This document explains how to invite new members and resend or delete pending invitations.

## System and user requirements

The ability to invite new password-authenticated members to your Sigma organization requires the following:

* You must be assigned the **Admin** [account type](/docs/create-and-manage-account-types#default-account-types).

> ðŸš§
>
> ### If your organization uses only SAML or OAuth to authenticate members, you must first assign new members in the IdP or authorization server. If a member receives an invite before this step is complete, they see an IdP error and will be unable to log in to Sigma.

## Invite a new user

To invite a new user to your Sigma organization:

1. Go to **Administration** > **Users**:

   1. In the Sigma header, click your user avatar to open the user menu.
   2. Select **Administration** to open the **Administration** portal.
   3. In the side panel, select **Users**.
2. In the **Users** page, click **Invite users**.
3. In the **Invite people to your Sigma organization** modal, set up and send the invitation:

   1. In the **Enter email addresses...** field, enter the email address of one or more members to invite.

      > ðŸ“˜
      >
      > ### Sigma recommends inviting no more than 1,000 members at a time.
   2. (Optional) In the **Guest users section**, select the **Invite as guest users** checkbox to limit user interactions to content explicitly shared with them or their assigned teams.
   3. (Optional) In the **Select account type** dropdown, select an account type to assign the new members. You can change the account type assigned by default. See [Manage default invitation account type](/docs/create-and-manage-account-types#manage-default-invitation-account-type).
   4. (Optional) In the **Add a custom message** field, enter a message to include in the invitation email. You can set up a default email message. See [Customize welcome and invite emails](/docs/customize-welcome-and-invite-emails) to set up a default email message.
   5. (Optional) In the **Assign team(s)** section, select the teams to assign the new members.
   6. Click **Invite** to send an invitation to the email addresses provided.

   2. Select **Administration** to open the **Administration** portal.
