# Manage scheduled exports

# Manage scheduled exports

You can view and manage scheduled exports, such as to stagger the schedules of exports, remove no longer needed scheduled exports, or to update the configuration of a scheduled export.

* [Manage schedules for a workbook](#manage-schedules-for-a-workbook).
* [Manage scheduled exports that you own or subscribe to](#view-and-manage-schedules-in-your-profile).
* As an admin, [manage all scheduled exports for your organization](/docs/manage-organization-schedules).

> ### If you have multiple scheduled exports, it's a best practice to stagger the schedules. Staggering schedules helps to reduce the load on Sigma and on the data warehouse.

## User requirements

The ability to send and schedule workbook exports requires the following:

* To export to a specific destination, you must be assigned an [account type](/docs/create-and-manage-account-types) with the export permission for that destination enabled.
* To schedule a workbook export, you must be assigned an [account type](/docs/create-and-manage-account-types) with the **Schedule export** permission enabled.
* You must be the workbook owner or be granted **Can explore** or **Can edit** [workbook permission](/docs/folder-and-document-permissions).

> ### Additional requirements and permissions might apply depending on the export destination.

#### Auto-paused scheduled exports

If a scheduled export fails more than 10 times consecutively, Sigma pauses the export schedule and the owner of the schedule receives an email notification.

The email notification contains the following message:

`Document export failed. Sigma has paused one of your scheduled exports. Please use the below link to the workbook to check details.`

You can manually resume the export. The **Status** column shows **Paused** with an exclamation point. To resume the paused export, choose **Resume** from the **More** menu in the **Actions** column.

![Schedule Exports page with a paused (!) export. Hovering over the (!) exclamation mark in a triangle icon shows information that "This schedule has been paused by Sigma on 07/13/2022 - 06:05 PM due to repeated failures. Error: Target Google Spreadsheet is not found." and provides an incident ID.](https://files.readme.io/d0a53ac-5.png)
