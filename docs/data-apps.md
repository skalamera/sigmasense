# About Sigma data apps

Data apps are purpose-built solutions that connect directly to your data platform to seamlessly integrate live data, workflows, and user inputs. You can leverage Sigma's write-back capabilities, advanced layout features, and rich user interactivity to build dynamic, user-driven applications that extend beyond standard data analysis and reports. From simple data collection forms and approval flows to more complex pipeline management and ticketing systems, Sigma supports a growing range of practical data app use cases.

## What makes a data app?

While you can incorporate any workbook feature into a data app, there are three key components of an interactive data app experience: input tables, layout elements, and actions.

Input tables

Layout elements

Actions

### 1. Input tables for data collection

Input tables allow users to securely add new data points, update existing inputs, and augment data from your data platform. This ability to collect data from users is essential to core data app functionality, allowing user interaction to modify data and generate specific outputs for scenario modeling, forecasting, reconciliation, and more.

For more information about input tables, see [Intro to input tables](/docs/intro-to-input-tables).

### 2. Layout elements for interface design

Layout elements provide the tools to design clean, focused interfaces that are easy to navigate. Containers and modals optimize how you deliver data and content, allowing you to organize information, guide workflows, and surface insights when and where users need them. Implement layout elements to help users perform data input and drill into details with efficiencyâ€”free from the distractions of unnecessary workbook clutter.

For more information about layout elements, see [Intro to layout elements](/docs/intro-to-layout-elements).

### 3. Actions for user interactivity

Actions are essential to building responsive data apps that automate user interactivity. Configure action conditions, triggers, and effects, to streamline scalable, data-driven workflows that support adaptive data exploration, run repeatable processes, and generate quick and relevant insights.

For more information, see [Intro to actions](/docs/intro-to-actions).
