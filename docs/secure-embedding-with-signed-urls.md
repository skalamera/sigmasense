> Secure embeds with URLs that are secured with client credentials, formerly known as user-backed embeds, are deprecated as of August 4, 2025 and will reach end of support early next year. Instead, migrate to secure embed URLs signed with JSON Web Token (JWT). See [Migrate to secure embed URLs signed with JWT](/docs/migrate-to-jwt-signed-secure-embed-urls) .

If you're using secure embeds with URLs secured with client credentials, refer to the following pages for support:

* [Generate a secure embed path](/docs/generate-a-secure-embed-path).
* [Example embed API and URL](/docs/example-embed-api-and-url).
* [Add URL parameters to a secure embed](/docs/add-url-parameters-to-a-secure-embed).
* [Secure embed error code reference](/docs/secure-embed-error-code-reference).
